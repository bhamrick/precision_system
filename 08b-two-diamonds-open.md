## In competition

Doubles by opener are generally takeout. This applies both to
2♦️-(2M)-P-(P) as well as 2♦️-(P)-P-(2M), though opener should take
care to recognize that it may not be wise to reopen with a double
with a mininum.

If direct seat overcalls with 2M, then a double by responder is
pass-or-correct, with interest in penalty if opener has 3 cards in
the major.
