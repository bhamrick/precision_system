# After 2:hearts:/2:spades:

Here M refers to the opened major and X refers to any other suit. A feature
is generally an ace or king, and never shortage. The meanings of maximum and
minimum are left unspecified, but adding a king to a maximum should take it
outside of the preempt range, either to pass in hopes of a better constructive
auction or to a one level opening.

* New suits natural and nonforcing. All strong hands (with interest in game)
  start with 2NT.
* 2NT! Artificial inquiry, invitational or better. Note that because of the light
  preempting style, an invitational hand needs to be quite strong. This can also
  be used for investigating slam and is often better suited for that purpose as
  you can safely sign off in 4M after any sequence of bids.
    * 3♣️! Any minimum
        * 3♦️! Asks for more clarification
            * 3M! Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature
            * 3X! 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
        * 3M Signoff
        * 4M Signoff
    * 3M! Maximum, Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature and
      generally has a shortage.
    * 3X! Maximum, 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
    * 3NT! Maximum, 6 card suit and no outside feature. If vulnerable, also
      denies shortage.
    * After any of the above clarifications, responder may still introduce a
      new suit naturally.
* 2NT is ON in competition if available.
* If the opponents double our weak 2 opening, then new suits are still
  nonforcing, and redouble is SOS showing a desire to run but without a clear
  suit preference.
