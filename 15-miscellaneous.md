* RKC 1430
    * Jump to 4NT after a suit-showing bid without an agreed denomination
      implicitly agrees the suit just shown.
    * After response:
        * Next step other than the trump suit is queen ask
            * Cheapest trump bid = no queen
            * Others = queen + king in shown suit
            * Notrump = queen + no outside king
        * 5NT is king ask, guarantees all relevant key cards
            * Responder bids cheapest king. A higher suit below the agreed trump
              can then be bid to ask responder to bid 7 with that king.
        * Directly bidding 6 of a suit lower than trump asks responder to bid 7
          with the queen of that suit and 6 otherwise. If space permits,
          responder may bid 6 of a higher suit still below the trump suit to
          deny the asked queen but show another queen.
    * DOPI over interference (Double = 0 or 3, Pass = 1 or 4, Step = 2 or 5 w/o
      queen, 2 steps = 2 or 5 w/ queen, assuming space permits)
* Exclusion Keycard
    * Jump to 5 of a suit shows a void in that suit and asks for keycards
      outside.
    * Responses are in steps:
        * First step 0 outside keycards
        * Second step 1 outside keycard without the trump queen
        * Third step 1 outside keycard with the trump queen
        * Fourth step 2 outside keycards without the trump queen
        * Fifth step 2 outside keycards with the trump queen
    * 3 keycards doesn't need a response because initiator will need to have one
      or else the 2 keycard response takes the auction too high.
* Minorwood
    * 4 of a minor is the keycard ask if the following conditions are met:
        * We are in a game forcing auction
        * We have not established a major fit
        * We have established a fit in the minor (even if it was implied or if
          4m is the first time it is shown).
    * Responses are the usual 1430 responses in steps.
        * First step 1 or 4
        * Second step 0 or 3
        * Third step 2 without queen
        * Fourth step 2 with queen
    * If available, the step up from the response is the queen ask, but 4NT is
      always to play and not the queen ask.
    * If clubs are trump, 5♦️ is the king ask, and if diamonds are trump, 5♥️ is
      the king ask. The 5NT response stands in to show the king of the suit used
      to ask.
    * If both Minorwood and SRAAACA would apply, Minorwood takes precedence.

## Lebensohl

### After a direct 2-level overcall of our 1NT opening

If the opponents overcall 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️ directly over our 1NT opening (systems
are on over 2♣️), regardless of which range, 2NT by responder is a relay to 3♣️ to
show a hand that is interested in competing to 3 level, but not interested in
investigating game (except in the case where responder continues by cue bidding
the opponent's suit). After the 3♣️ relay, responder either passes or bids their
suit naturally.

For suits above the overcalled suit, introducing the suit at two level is
nonforcing. Lebensohl can be used to show an invitational hand. Jumping to
three level shows a game force.

Cue bidding the opponent's suit is instead stayman, either showing a stopper in
the overcalled suit or not depending on whether the 2NT relay is used. The
direct cue bid denies a stopper ("fast denies"), while the relay and then cue
bidding shows a stopper ("slow shows").

Over a balancing overcall, responder has already passed, presumably denying game
interest, so Lebensohl does not apply.

Example situation: 1NT-(2♥️)-?
* 2♠️ Natural and nonforcing
* 2NT! Lebensohl
    * 3♣️! Forced
        * Pass Hand that wants to compete to 3♣️ but without game interest
        * 3♦️ Hand that wants to compete to 3♦️ but without game interest
        * 3♥️! "Stayman with a stopper", game forcing
        * 3♠️ Natural and invitational
* 3♣️ Natural and invitational
* 3♦️ Natural and invitational
* 3♥️! "Stayman without a stopper", game forcing
* 3♠️ Natural and game forcing
* 3NT To play

### After a takeout double of an opposing weak 2

If the opponents open a weak 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️, and our side doubles for takeout,
2NT is a relay to 3♣️ to show a weak hand (generally 0-7). Unlike in the previous
situation, sometimes the doubler will break the relay to show a very strong hand
that has interest in going further despite the 0-7 points.

Example situation: (2♥️)-X-?
* 2♠️ Natural and weak
* 2NT! Lebensohl, generally shows a weak hand
    * 3♣️! Nearly forced, shows that it was not a power double
        * Pass Wants to play 
        * 3♦️ Natural and weak
        * 3♥️! "Stayman with a stopper", game forcing
        * 3♠️ Natural and invitational
* 3♣️ Natural and invitational
* 3♦️ Natural and invitational
* 3♥️! "Stayman without a stopper", game forcing
* 3♠️ Natural and game forcing
* 3NT To play

## Unusual vs Unusual

If the opponents make a bid showing two known suits (such as Michael's or
Unusual 2NT), then a cue bid of the lower suit is a stronger bid of the lower
unshown suit, and a cue bid of the higher suit is a stronger bid of the higher
unshown suit. Strength for the cue bids is usually inv+, or 8-10 if by a passed
hand. As a consequence, bidding one of the other two suits naturally is merely
competitive.

Examples:
* After 1♦️-(2♦️), if 2♦️ shows both majors then 2♥️ is a strong club bid and 2♠️ is
  a strong diamond bid.
* After 1♥️-(2NT) showing both minors, 3♣️ is a strong heart raise, and 3♦️ is a
  strong spade bid.

## Cue bid of an opposing weak 2

After the opponents open with a weak 2, the direct cue bid is a stopper ask,
showing a hand that is looking for 3NT, but lacks a stopper and is unsuitable
for a takeout double. The exact nature of the hand is unspecified; it could be
a strong balanced hand without a stopper or a hand with a likely running
suit.

## 3-suit Keycard

If opener has shown a 3-suited hand (for example, after a 2♦️ opening), then 4♣️,
4♦️, and 4NT are the keycard asks in the low, middle, and high suits
respectively, as long as none are needed as signoff bids. If some are signoff,
then the remaining bids are keycard for as many suits as possible, prioritizing
long suits, and higher suits between those of equal length. In all cases, the
cheaper bid corresponds to keycard in the lower suit.

When 3-suit keycard applies, the suit above the trump suit is the king asking
bid, with one very important exception. If not every suit was available to
keycard in, then a bid in the unavailable suit should be considered signoff
instead of king ask. The first available bid (possibly 5NT) is the king ask
instead. This allows the captain to keycard in another suit if they deem that
information to be good enough for finding slam in the unavailable suit. When
responding to the king ask, 5NT fills in as indicating the king of the suit used
to initiate the ask.

Example 1: After a 2♦️ opening, a direct response of 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️
is keycard in hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 2: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️ showing 3=4=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is not needed as
signoff (responder could pass), so 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in
hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 3: After 2♦️-2NT-3♦️ showing 4=3=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is a signoff
bid, so only 4♦️ and 4NT are keycard bids. In this case, hearts is the shortest
suit and therefore not given a keycard bid, so 4♦️ is keycard in clubs and 4NT is
keycard in spades.

Example 4: After 2♦️-2NT-3♠️ showing 4=4=1=4 and a maximum without the diamond A
or K, 4♣️ and 4♦️ are not needed as signoff as opener has shown a maximum after an
invitational bid. Therefore, 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in hearts,
and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 5: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️-3♦️-3♥️ Showing 3=4=1=5 and a minimum, 4♣️ is a signoff
so 4♦️ is keycard in clubs and 4NT is keycard in hearts. After a response to 4NT,
5♠️ is a signoff indicating that responder had long spades, since it was
impossible to keycard in spades, and 5NT is instead the king ask.

## Doubles of an opponent's 1 minor opening

### Direct doubles of 1:clubs: that contains weak (less than 15) options

This category includes standard 1♣️, Polish Club, "may be short" 1♣️ with transfer
responses, Tangerine Club, and so on. It also includes strong 1♣️ where the range
starts at 14 or lower, such as some versions of MOSCITO.

Double is a major-oriented takeout double. Power doubles are still included.
Most of the balanced hands that would open 1♦️ fall into this category, but you
should always have at least 4-3 in the majors. The exact point range is still to
be determined, but should not be much lighter than an opening. Responses are
similar to responding to a 1♦️ opening, but with an artificial negative response.
Alternatively, you can think about this as similar to responding to a Polish
Club.

* After (1♣️) X (P)
    * 1♦️ Usually 0-8 points, does not have a 4 card major if 7-8. Could be up to
      10 with a long minor that does not want to bid NT.
        * 1♥️ 4♥️s, may also have 4♠️s less than power double, nonforcing
        * 1♠️ 4♠️s without 4♥️s, less than power double, nonforcing
            * After these 1♥️ or 1♠️ bids, all bids are nonforcing, but both sides
              should be inclined to bid if at the top of their range.
        * 1NT 18-19 balanced
            * 1NT systems are on
        * 2♣️, 2♦️, 2♥️, 2♠️ Natural, power double strength
    * 1♥️ 7+ points, 4+♥️s, forcing
        * Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♥️, including 2 way checkback when
          applicable.
    * 1♠️ 7+ points, 4+♠️s, forcing, usually longer ♠️ than ♥️
        * Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♠️, including 2 way checkback when
          applicable.
    * 1NT 9-11 balanced
    * 2♣️ 11+ points, 5+♣️, forcing
        * Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♣️
    * 2♦️ 11+ points, 5+♦️, forcing
        * Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♦️
    * 2♥️ Weak, 6+♥️s
        * Opener should still continue bidding with power double strength.
    * 2♠️ Weak, 6+♠️s
        * Opener should still continue bidding with power double strength.
    * 2NT 12-13 balanced

### Doubles of a purely strong (always 15+) 1:clubs: or 1:diamonds:

This category includes Precision's 1♣️, Magic Diamond's 1♦️, and so on.

Double shows 4-4 or better in the majors. Compared to doubling a standard 1♣️,
the hand may be weaker. Because the opponents have made a strong opening, there
is no emphasis on finding a game, and more emphasis on preempting when possible.
This meaning also applies to doubling the artificial negative response (e.g.
against Precision, (1♣️) P (1♦️) X would be majors).

### Direct doubles of a natural 1:diamonds:

This category includes standard 1♦️, especially those that are paired with a "may
be short" 1♣️ to guarantee 5. The original Precision 1♦️ also promised 4+, and
would fall into this category.

Double is takeout. However, there is still some major bias because it pays to be
aggressive with overcalling 2♣️ with 5, as it makes it significantly more
difficult for the opponents to find their 4-4 major fit.

### Doubles of a "may be short" 1:diamonds:

This category includes modern Precision 1♦️ (whether 0+, 1+, or 2+).

Double is takeout of either minor (either minor can be the short suit), which
typically means that it will have at least 4-3 in majors. Responses are like
responding to a takeout double, but biased toward the majors.

### Balancing doubles

After the auction (1♣️) P (P), even if opener doesn't have clubs, responder
generally will.

Double is takeout.
