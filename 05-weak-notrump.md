# After 11-13 1NT

* 2♣️ Stayman. The same weak hands are allowed as over the 14-16 1NT. With these
  weak hands you can also consider waiting for opponents to double and then
  utilize the runout system.
* 2♦️! Game forcing relay. Opener describes their exact shape via a sequence of
  bids. Responder can bid a game to sign off at any time. The general pattern is
  for responder to bid the major they don't have, then disambiguate 4 cards or 5
  cards, and then bid their doubleton, with the nearby bids filling in for
  doubletons that would take too much space to bid directly.

    * After opener has shown their shape, a responder interested in slam may bid
      the cheapest bid (or 4♣️ if the cheapest bid would be 3NT) to ask for
      controls (A=2, K=1):
        * Step 1: 0 controls
        * Step 2: 1 control
        * Step 3: 2 controls
        * etc
    * If the opponents double 2♦️, relays are on and redouble is an attempt to
      cash in.
    * Relays are off over any other interference over 2♦️. Doubles are penalty as
      usual for game forcing auctions.
    * If you've chosen to open a (24)(25) hand 1NT, show the major doubleton and
      bid as if it's (24)(34) accordingly.
* 2♥️ To play
* 2♠️ To play
* 2NT! Weak with both minors
* 3♣️/3♦️/3♥️/3♠️ Invitational natural (usually 6 cards for the minors)
* 3NT To play

## Runouts after 1NT-X or 1NT-P-P-X-P-P

Over a double, runouts are akin to our strong notrump defense.
Runouts are on regardless of whether the double is meant as penalty or not.

* Pass Suggests playing 1NTx
* XX Relays to 2♣️ showing either a single minor or both majors
* 2♣️ Clubs and a higher suit (Note: In the defense this is clubs and a major,
  but we would rather not force ourselves to run to 3 level with both minors).
* 2♦️ Diamonds and a higher suit
* 2♥️ Natural, to play
* 2♠️ Natural, to play

Any continuation by responder after the natural conclusion of the runout shows
at least invitational values and is forcing. Any suit bid by opener other than
the cheapest one shows a good 5 card suit suggesting to play there rather than
looking for a fit in one of responder's suits.
