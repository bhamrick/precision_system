# After 1♦️\*

* 1♥️ 4+♥️s, one round forcing. With 4/4 spades and hearts and less than game
  forcing values, responder typically starts with 1♥️.
    * 1♠️ 4♠️s, possibly balanced
        * 2-way checkback is on
        * 2♠️ Simple raise (invite would go through 2♣️)
        * Bids above 2♠️ are game tries with a spade fit, with the same meaning
          as if the bidding started 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️.
    * 1NT Balanced outside of the 1NT opening range, denies 4♠️s
    * 2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    * 2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
    * 2♥️ 4♥️s any strength
* 1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing.
    * 1NT Balanced outside of the 1NT opening range.
    * 2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    * 2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
    * 2♥️! Exactly 3=4=5=1, any strength
        * 2NT! Artificial invitational+ asking bid
            * 3♣️! Any minimum
            * 3♦️!, 3♥️!, 3♠️!, 3NT! Maximum with ace or king in suit bid (or clubs
              if NT) and none of the cheaper ones.
    * 2♠️ 4♠️s any strength
* 1NT Nonforcing
* 2♣️! 11+ points, 5+♣️s. Generally denies a 4 card major unless game forcing values. Somewhat artificial rebids:
    * 2♦️! Any minimum without 4♥️s
        * 2♥️! Artificial game force, asks for clarification.
            * Opener continus by bidding shape naturally.
        * 2♠️ Nonforcing, 4♠️s
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s 
        * 3♦️ Signoff
        * 3♥️! 6+♣️s, 5+♥️s, slam seeking
        * 3♠️!, 6+♣️s, 5+♠️s, slam seeking
        * 3NT Signoff
    * 2♥️! Minimum with 4♥️s
        * Pass To play
        * 2♠️! Artificial game force
            * Opener continues bidding naturally.
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️, Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        * 3♦️ Signoff
        * 3♥️ Invitation to 4♥️, looking for good minimums
    * 2♠️! Maximum, 4♠️s
    * 2NT! Maximum, natural
    * 3♣️! Maximum, 4+♣️s
    * 3♦️! Maximum, 6+♦️s
    * 3♥️! Maximum, 4♥️s
    * After maximum responses, the auction is forcing to game and continuations
      are natural. If responder confirms a fit below game level that implies
      slam interest (fast arrival).
* 2♦️! 11+ points, 5+♦️s, similar rebids as after 2♣️:
    * 2♥️! Any minimum
        * 2♠️! Artificial game force
            * Opener continues bidding shape naturally
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        * 3♦️ Signoff
    * Others are maximum and natural, with natural continuations.
    * Since opener won't show a 4 card major unless responder game forces, it
      will usually be better to bid 1♥️ or 1♠️ with a 4 card major and without
      slam interest. On the other hand, when responder does have slam interest,
      2♦️ will make it easier to find a good diamond fit if it exists.
* 2♥️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long hearts
* 2♠️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long spades
* 2NT Balanced, invitational to game
* 3♣️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs
* 3♦️! Preemptive raise
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* After a 1♦️-1M-1NT sequence showing 11-13 balanced,
  [2 way checkback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_RD8ycgRT8) is on
    * 2♣️! Weak with diamonds or various invitational hands
        * 2♦️! Forced relay, then responder clarifies
            * Pass Weak with diamonds
            * 2M Invitational with 5+M
            * 2OM Invitational with 4+OM
    * 2♦️! Artificial game forcing. Natural continuations, favoring lowest bids.
        * 2M 3 card support
        * 2OM 4 card unbid major
    * 2M Pulling for partscore, less than invitational values
* Checkback also applies after 1♦️-1♥️-1♠️, with one addition
    * 1NT Nonforcing and less than invitational. With a hand unsuitable for
      playing 1NT, opener bids 2♣️ with a minor two-suiter or 2♦️ with long
      diamonds.
* After 1♦️-1♥️-2m, opener has shown an unbalanced hand and denied 4 spades.
  Responder's 2♠️ bid is an artifical game force, and opener should continue to
  describe their hand, especially showing 3 card support for a major,
  prioritizing hearts.
* After 1♦️-1M-2M, Kokish game tries are available for invitational hands, but
  generally discouraged as they give a significant amount of information to the
  defense. Despite being called game tries, they may also be used to investigate
  slam as opener is forced to bid whether they are accepting or not.
    * Next step (1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified help suit game try.
        * Opener bids the cheapest suit where they have help (generally first or
          second round control). If the auction was 1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows
          the spade help and is considered the cheapest. Afterward, responder
          can sign off in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another suit asking opener to
          bid game if they have a first or second control in that suit.
        * Opener is also free to bid game directly if they have help in every
          suit or maximal values.
    * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
        * Opener reevaluates their hand in the context of shortness and decides
          whether to bid game or not. Maximal hands may choose to play game even
          with wasted values.
