# After 14-16 1NT or 1:clubs:!-1:diamonds:!-1NT

* 2♣️ Stayman
    * Could be several hand types, but always includes a 4 card major:
        * Garbage stayman (3 suited hand with short clubs)
        * Crawling stayman (weak hand with both majors)
        * Weak hand with a 4 card major and a long (probably 6) card minor
        * With a serious invite and 5/4 majors instead start by transferring to
          the 5 card major.
            * With a 5/4 major hand that only occaisionally wants to invite
              across fitting hands, start with Stayman.
    * 2♦️ No 4+ card major
        * Pass Garbage stayman or weak with a major and long ♦️s
        * 2♥️ Crawling stayman - weak with both majors. Could be 4-4 for
          tactical reasons, but will have longer or equal hearts.
            * Opener passes except with exactly 3♠️s and 2♥️s
        * 2♠️ Weak with 5♠️s and 4♥️s
        * 2NT Invitational
        * 3♣️!/3♦️! Signoff - weak with a 4 card major and 6 cards in the bid minor

        * 3♠️! Smolen - Game forcing with 5♥️s and 4♠️s
    * 2♥️ 4+♥️s, could have 4♠️s
        * 2♠️ Bad invite with 4♠️s.
        * 2NT Invitational without heart fit (implies a 4 card ♠️ suit),
          slightly stronger than hands that would bid 2♠️
        * 3♣️/3♦️ Weak with 4♠️s and 6 cards in the bid minor
        * 3♥️ Invitational with a heart fit. Opener can bid 3NT to accept if they
          want to offer a choice of games.
        * 3♠️! Slam try in ♥️s
    * 2♠️ 4+♠️s, denies 4♥️s
        * 2NT Invitational without spade fit (implies a 4 card ♥️ suit)

        * 3♦️! Signoff - Weak with 4♥️s and long ♦️s
        * 3♥️! Slam try in ♠️s
        * 3♠️  Invitational with a spade fit. Opener can bid 3NT to accept if
          they want to offer a choice of games.
* 2♦️\* Jacoby transfer to ♥️
    * 2♥️ Generally forced
        * 2♠️! Invitational with 5♥️s and 4♠️s
        * Other new suits are game forcing and natural.
* 2♥️\* Jacoby transfer to ♠️
    * 2♠️ Generally forced
        * 3♥️! Invitational with 5♠️ and 4♥️s
        * Other new suits are game forcing and natural.
* 2♠️! Size ask or transfer to clubs
    * 2NT! Minimum
        * 3♣️ Says responder had clubs and wants to sign off
    * 3♣️! Maximum
* 2NT! Transfer to diamonds. Opener responds similar to a size ask despite the
  fact that responder always has the diamonds, to assist in judgment if looking
  for slam.
    * 3♣️! Bad hand/support
        * 3♦️ Sign off
        * Others are game forcing
    * 3♦️! Good hand and support
        * Further bids by responder are game forcing
* 3♣️! Game forcing puppet stayman; "low information" version
    * 3♦️! No 5 card major
        * 3♥️! Asks for 4 spades
            * 3♠️ Yes
            * 3NT No
        * 3♠️! Asks for 4 hearts
            * 3NT No
            * 4♥️ Yes
        * After a 4 card major ask and then 3NT, South African Texas transfers
          are available, which could be done with some unusual holdings like
          6/4 in majors (check for a 4-4 fit, then transfer to the 6 card suit
          if not).
    * 3♥️ 5♥️s
    * 3♠️ 5♠️s
    * This version of puppet is "low information" because opener doesn't
      guarantee a 4 card major with the 3♦️ bid. This is possible over 1NT
      because responder will never want to ask about both majors after choosing
      puppet. If they cared about 4 card support in both majors (for example
      with 4/4 or 5/4 in majors) they would have started with 2♣️ for regular
      stayman.
* 3♦️! Game forcing with 5-5 majors
    * Opener's rebids follow fast arrival.
    * 3♥️/3♠️ Fit with a not terrible hand.
    * 3NT Good holdings in both minors, no good fit.
    * 4♥️/4♠️ Fit with a bad hand.
* 3♥️! Game forcing 31(45) (Short ♥️)
    * 3♠️ Fit with a not terrible hand.
    * 3NT Game preference, showing good stoppers in ♥️
    * 4♣️/4♦️ Strong hand with minor fit. Starts a control bidding sequence
      instead of Minorwood because responder is better suited to be captain.
    * 4♥️ Strong slam try in ♠️ (5 card suit and appropriately placed honors).
    * 4♠️/5♣️/5♦️ Weaker hands with the shown fit.
* 3♠️! Game forcing 13(45) (Short ♠️)
    * 3NT Game preference, showing good stoppers in ♠️
    * 4♣️/4♦️ Strong hand with minor fit. Starts a control bidding sequence
      instead of Minorwood because responder is better suited to be captain.
    * 4♥️/5♣️/5♦️ Weaker hands with the shown fit.
    * 4♠️ Strong slam try in ♥️ (5 card suit and appropriately placed honors).
* 4♣️\* Texas transfer to ♥️
* 4♦️\* Texas transfer to ♠️
* 4♥️ To play
* 4♠️ To play
* Systems are on over X and 2♣️
    * After 1NT-(X), XX is running with either a single minor or both majors.
* Over any interference, Texas transfers are on if the 4♣️ or 4♦️ bid is a jump.
