# Guiding Principles

* Open light. Bidding is more fun than not bidding, and also comes with
  some preemptive benefits. Even playing standard, 11 point hands sometimes get
  upgraded to pretend to be a 13 count. We just systematically open them.
  * However, light is not trash. E.g. 10 point balanced hand is not worth an upgrade.
* Establish a captain of the auction quickly. For openings other than 1♣️,
  responder is immediately the captain as opener's range is limited.
  * If the auction goes P-1♣️-positive response, then responder is known to be
    8-10 and therefore opener is captain.
  * For 1♣️-positive response from nonpassed hands, we have an agreement called
    SRAAACA to define the range of one of the hands.
* Play partscores two levels below game when possible. For example, 3♥️ is really
  only a good place to be when you're making exactly 9 tricks. The effect of
  this can be seen in the invite sequences. For example, 2♣️-2♦️-2♥️ implies a
  minimum so that we don't need to continue to the 3 level when responder is
  invitational (opener would be 3♥️ instead with a maximum).
  * This does not apply for preemptive bids
* Game force early to have plenty of bidding space for finding the right game or
  slam.
  * Note: That bidding space is not particularly well used yet.
* Be Basic Chart legal. Both partners are significantly below 750 masterpoints
  and we don't want to practice a Basic+ system just to need to switch when
  playing at events with low limits.

# Notation

Throughout the document, a ! next to a bid means it's alertable. A \* indicates
that it would carry an announcement. Alerts at 4 level and higher starting with
opener's rebid are delayed alerts instead.

# Openings

* 1♣️! 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced (except 2NT opening hands)
* 1♦️\* 11-15 catchall (always 3+♦️s or balanced, always 2+♦️s)
* 1♥️ 11-15 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ 11-15 5+♠️s
* 1NT\* 14-16 balanced. Balanced hands including 5 card majors are opened 1NT if
  they are in the appropriate point range.
* 2♣️! 11-15 6+♣️s
* 2♦️! 11-15, one of 3=4=1=5, 4=3=1=5, 4=4=0=5, or 4=4=1=4
* 2♥️ Weak, generally 5-10
* 2♠️ Weak, generally 5-10
* 2NT 20-21 balanced
* 3NT! Gambling (Solid 7 card minor suit e.g. AKQxxxx, minimum opening strength
  or less)

## Notrump ranges

For quick reference, this is our "Notrump ladder". Systems are generally on in
all cases, but for the 2NT bids we use Puppet Stayman.

* 11-13 1♦️\*-1M-1NT
* 14-16 1NT\*
* 17-19 1♣️!-1♦️!-1NT
* 20-21 2NT
* 22-23 1♣️!-1♦️!-2NT
* 24+ 1♣️!-1♦️!-3NT

# Responses

## After 1♣️!

* 1♦️! Negative 0-7, all other bids are game forcing
    * 1♥️ 16-21 5+♥️s, nonforcing
    * 1♠️ 16-21 5+♠️s, nonforcing
    * 1NT 17-19 balanced, systems on
    * 2♣️ 16-21 4+♣️s, nonforcing
    * 2♦️ 16-21 4+♦️s, nonforcing
    * 2♥️ 22+ 5+♥️s, forcing
    * 2♠️ 22+ 5+♠️s, forcing
    * 2NT 22-23 balanced, nonforcing, systems on
    * 3♣️ 22+ 4+♣️s, forcing
    * 3♦️ 22+ 4+♦️s, forcing
    * 3NT 24+ balanced, stayman and transfers available
* 1♥️ 8+ 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ 8+ 5+♠️s
* 1NT 8-11 balanced
* 2♣️ 8+ 5+♣️s
* 2♦️ 8+ 5+♦️s
* 2♥️! 8+ 4441 singleton heart
    * After any of the 4441 responses, a bid below game by opener creates
      agreement on the strain and responder will bid according to SRAAACA.
* 2♠️! 8+ 4441 singleton spade
* 2NT! 12+ balanced
* 3♣️! 8+ 4441 singleton club
* 3♦️! 8+ 4441 singleton diamond

## After 1♦️\*

* 1♥️ 4+♥️s, one round forcing
* 1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
* 1NT Nonforcing
* 2♣️! Artificial game forcing. May have 4 card majors. Opener bids 4 card suits up the line.
* 2♦️ Constructive raise
* 3♦️ Preemptive raise
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.

## After 1♥️/1♠️

* 1♥️-1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
* 1NT\* Semiforcing. Opener passes with the 11-13 5332, bids 4 card side suit or
  rebids 6 card major otherwise.
* 2/1 responses are game forcing and natural
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* 2♥️/2♠️ Invitational with 3+ card support
    * Opener generally passes or bids 4♥️/4♠️ directly. For borderline hands,
      Kokish game tries are available (description below). However, they are
      discouraged as they will often be more valuable tips for the defense than
      value for us finding the right contract.
        * Next step (1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified long suit game try.
            * Responder bids the cheapest first or second round control. If the
              auction was 1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows the spade control and is
              considered the cheapest. Afterward, opener can sign off in
              3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another suit asking responder to bid
              game if they have a first or second control in that suit.
        * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
            * Responder bids 4♥️/4♠️ if they do not have wasted values in the suit
              bid, and 3♥️/3♠️ otherwise.
* 2NT! Game forcing raise with 4+ card support, slam seeking.
    * 3♣️! Minimum without a void
        * 3♦️! Asks (Compare these responses to the immediate response to 2NT with
          a max)
            * 3♥️! Singleton, no long side suit
                * 3♠️! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
            * 3♠️ Unused
            * 3NT! No singleton or long side suit
            * 4♣️! 5+ card club suit
            * 4♦️! 5+ card diamond suit
            * 4♥️! 5+ cards in the other major
    * 3♦️! Minimum with a void
        * 3♥️! Asks where (use 3♠️! for the other major)

# Bidding during game forcing auctions

* Until agreement about denomination, non-jump bids are natural
* Jump bids are splinters, showing a singleton or void in the suit bid and
  implicitly agreeing the last denomination bid.
* After agreement, bids are:
    * Reasonable games are to play or choice of games. A game is reasonable if
      it is 3NT, the suit agreed, or in a suit that was previously bid naturally
      by the other player. Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, the reasonable games are
      3NT, 4♥️, and 5♣️.
        * 4NT is generally keycard and not an offer to play
        * If hearts or spades was bid naturally, then 5♥️/5♠️ is generally an
          offer to play if the auction is already passed the corresponding 4
          level game.
    * If a captain is not established, the next bid is SRAAACA (see below), and
      the other player becomes captain.
    * If a captain is established (Responder after any non-1♣️ opening, opener if
      responder made a positive response to 1♣️ as a passed hand), then:
        * A bid by the non-captain is a cue bid, showing a 1st or 2nd round
          control in the suit bid, and denying such controls that could have
          been shown with cheaper bids. A notrump bid denies all controls that
          could have been shown with a cheaper bid.
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-2♦️-2♥️, responder is captain but opener is to
              bid, so they start with a cue bid after which responder can make
              asking bids.
        * A bid by the captain is asking about the non-captain's holding in the
          suit bid, with the following steps:
            * Step 1: No help (xx or worse)
            * Step 2: Unreliable second round control e.g. Kx
            * Step 3: Reliable second round control e.g. KQx
            * Step 4: Singleton (not ace)
            * Step 5: Ace
            * Step 6: Void
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, 3♦️! asks about diamonds with 3♥️! being
              step 1, 3♠️ being step 2, 3NT being step 3, and so on.
        * If the asking bid suit was previously bid naturally by the player
          being asked, the scale is different (note: the bid must be below game,
          otherwise it is a reasonable game and therefore an offer to play).
            * Step 1: No top honors (A/K/Q)
            * Step 2: One top honor
            * Step 3: Two top honors
            * Step 4: Three top honors
            * Step 5: Three top honors and 6+ cards
* Doubles are penalty

## SRAAACA (pronounced like Sriracha)

The name stands for "Strength Response After Agreement in Ambiguous Captain
Auctions". If both sides are unlimited during a game forcing auction (only
positive responses by a non-passed hand after 1♣️ opening) and agreement occurs
below game level, the next bid defines the strength of the hand and the hand
that created the agreement becomes the captain.

Responses are overlapping 3-point intervals spaced 2 apart. Judgment should be
used to decide whether to show borderline hands in the higher or lower range.

Example: After 1♣️-1♥️-2♥️, responder is 8+ so the steps are

* 2♠️! 8-10
* 2NT! 10-12
* 3♣️! 12-14
* 3♦️! 14-16
* And so on

Example 2: After 1♣️-1♥️-1♠️-2♠️, opener is 16+ so the steps are

* 2NT! 16-18
* 3♣️! 18-20
* 3♦️! 20-22
* 3♥️! 22-24
* And so on

If agreement was made by a splinter, values should be adjusted to account for
wasted values in the short suit, and there is an extra step for hands that get
adjusted to sub-minimum. 

Example 3: After 1♣️-1♥️-3♦️!

* 3♥️! Worse than 8
* 3♠️! 8-10
* 3NT! 10-12
* And so on

# Miscellaneous

* RKC 1430
    * Jump to 4NT after a suit-showing bid without an agreed denomination
      implicitly agrees the suit just shown.
    * After response:
        * Next step other than the trump suit is queen ask
            * Cheapest trump bid = no queen
            * Others = queen + king in shown suit
            * Notrump = queen + no outside king
        * 5NT is king ask, guarantees all relevant key cards
            * Responder bids cheapest king. A higher suit below the agreed trump
              can then be bid to ask responder to bid 7 with that king.
        * Directly bidding 6 of a suit lower than trump asks responder to bid 7
          with the queen of that suit and 6 otherwise. If space permits,
          responder may bid 6 of a higher suit still below the trump suit to
          deny the asked queen but show another queen.
    * DOPI over interference (Double = 0 or 3, Pass = 1 or 4, Step = 2 or 5 w/o
      queen, 2 steps = 2 or 5 w/ queen, assuming space permits)
