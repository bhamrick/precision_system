# Guiding Principles

* Open light. Bidding is more fun than not bidding, and also comes with
  some preemptive benefits. Even playing standard, 11 point hands sometimes get
  upgraded to pretend to be a 13 count. We just systematically open them.
  * However, light is not trash. E.g. 10 point balanced hand is not worth an upgrade.
* Establish a captain of the auction quickly. For openings other than 1♣️,
  responder is immediately the captain as opener's range is limited.
  * If the auction goes P-1♣️-positive response, then responder is known to be
    8-10 and therefore opener is captain.
  * For 1♣️-positive response from nonpassed hands, we have an agreement called
    SRAAACA to define the range of one of the hands.
* Play partscores two levels below game when possible. For example, 3♥️ is really
  only a good place to be when you're making exactly 9 tricks. The effect of
  this can be seen in the invite sequences. For example, 2♣️-2♦️-2♥️ implies a
  minimum so that we don't need to continue to the 3 level when responder is
  invitational (opener would be 3♥️ instead with a maximum).
  * This does not apply for preemptive bids
* Game force early to have plenty of bidding space for finding the right game or
  slam.
  * Note: That bidding space is not particularly well used yet.
* Be Basic Chart legal. Both partners are significantly below 750 masterpoints
  and we don't want to practice a Basic+ system just to need to switch when
  playing at events with low limits.

# Notation

Throughout the document, a ! next to a bid means it's alertable. A \* indicates
that it would carry an announcement. Alerts at 4 level and higher starting with
opener's rebid are delayed alerts instead.

# Openings

* 1♣️! 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced (except 2NT opening hands)

* 1♥️ Good 10-15 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ Good 10-15 5+♠️s
* 1NT\* 14-16 balanced. Balanced hands including 5 card majors are opened 1NT if
  they are in the appropriate point range.
* 2♣️! Good 10-15 6+♣️s

* 2♥️ Weak, generally 5-bad 10
* 2♠️ Weak, generally 5-bad 10
* 2NT 20-21 balanced
* 3NT! Gambling (Solid 7 card minor suit e.g. AKQxxxx, minimum opening strength
  or less)

## Notrump ranges

For quick reference, this is our "Notrump ladder". Systems are generally on in
all cases, but for the 2NT bids we use Puppet Stayman.

* 11-13 1♦️\*-1M-1NT
* 14-16 1NT\*
* 17-19 1♣️!-1♦️!-1NT
* 20-21 2NT
* 22-23 1♣️!-1♦️!-2NT
* 24+ 1♣️!-1♦️!-3NT

# Responses

## After 1♣️!

* 1♦️! Negative 0-7, all other bids are game forcing
    * 1♥️ 16-21 5+♥️s, nonforcing
    * 1♠️ 16-21 5+♠️s, nonforcing
    * 1NT 17-19 balanced, systems on
    * 2♣️ 16-21 4+♣️s, nonforcing
    * 2♦️ 16-21 4+♦️s, nonforcing
    * 2♥️ 22+ 5+♥️s, forcing
    * 2♠️ 22+ 5+♠️s, forcing
    * 2NT 22-23 balanced, nonforcing, systems on
    * 3♣️ 22+ 4+♣️s, forcing
    * 3♦️ 22+ 4+♦️s, forcing
    * 3NT 24+ balanced, stayman and transfers available
* 1♥️ 8+ 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ 8+ 5+♠️s
* 1NT! 8-11 or 14+ balanced. After this opening, the first SRAAACA range is
  8-11, then 14-16, etc.
    * 2♣️! Asks for 4 card major. To keep auctions lower, use transfer responses:
        * 2♦️! 4♥️s
        * 2♥️! 4♠️s
        * 2♠️! No 4 card major
            * 2NT "sets" notrump and asks for SRAAACA.
        * Opener can complete the transfer to confirm the fit, which initiates
          SRAAACA, or bid another suit naturally to ask for support.
* 2♣️ 8+ 5+♣️s
* 2♦️ 8+ 5+♦️s
* 2♥️! 8+ 4441 singleton heart
    * After any of the 4441 responses, a bid below game by opener creates
      agreement on the strain and responder will bid according to SRAAACA.
* 2♠️! 8+ 4441 singleton spade
* 2NT! 12-13 balanced
    * 3♣️! Asks for 4 card major. Similar to the 1NT response, use
      transfer respones here as well.
        * 3♦️! 4♥️s
        * 3♥️! 4♠️s
        * 3♠️! No 4 card major
        * Completing the transfer at 3 level shows slam interest. Opener should
          jump to game with minimum hands and a fit.
* 3♣️! 8+ 4441 singleton club
* 3♦️! 8+ 4441 singleton diamond

## After 1♦️\*

* 1♥️ 4+♥️s, one round forcing
* 1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
* 1NT Nonforcing
* 2♣️! Artificial game forcing. May have 4 card majors. Opener bids 4 card suits up the line.
* 2♦️ Constructive raise
* 2♥️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long hearts
* 2♠️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long spades
* 3♣️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs
* 3♦️! Preemptive raise
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* After a 1♦️-1M-1NT sequence showing 11-13 balanced,
  [2 way checkback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_RD8ycgRT8) is on
    * 2♣️! Weak with diamonds or various invitational hands
        * 2♦️! Forced relay, then responder clarifies
            * Pass Weak with diamonds
            * 2M Invitational with 5+M
            * 2OM Invitational with 4+OM
    * 2♦️! Artificial game forcing. Natural continuations, favoring lowest bids.
        * 2M 3 card support
        * 2OM 4 card unbid major
    * 2M Pulling for partscore, less than invitational values

## After 1♥️/1♠️

* 1♥️-1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
    * After 1♥️-1♠️-1NT, 2 way checkback is on with similar structure as after
      1♦️-1M-1NT
* 1NT\* Semiforcing. Opener may pass with 11-13 balanced or semibalanced, bids 4
  card side suit or rebids 6 card major otherwise. A side suit bid of 2♠️ should
  only be made with either near-max values or 6/5+ distribution (minimum 5/5
  hands would open 1♠️).
* 2/1 responses are game forcing and natural
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* 2♥️/2♠️ Invitational with 3+ card support
    * Opener generally passes or bids 4♥️/4♠️ directly. For borderline hands,
      Kokish game tries are available (description below). However, they are
      discouraged as they will often be more valuable tips for the defense than
      value for us finding the right contract.
        * Next step (1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified long suit game try.
            * Responder bids the cheapest first or second round control. If the
              auction was 1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows the spade control and is
              considered the cheapest. Afterward, opener can sign off in
              3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another suit asking responder to bid
              game if they have a first or second control in that suit.
        * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
            * Responder bids 4♥️/4♠️ if they do not have wasted values in the suit
              bid, and 3♥️/3♠️ otherwise.
* 2NT! Game forcing raise with 4+ card support, slam seeking.
    * 3♣️! Minimum without a void
        * 3♦️! Asks (Compare these responses to the immediate response to 2NT with
          a max)
            * 3♥️! Singleton, no long side suit
                * 3♠️! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
            * 3♠️ Unused
            * 3NT! No singleton or long side suit
            * 4♣️! 5+ card club suit
            * 4♦️! 5+ card diamond suit
            * 4♥️! 5+ cards in the other major
    * 3♦️! Minimum with a void
        * 3♥️! Asks where (use 3♠️! for the other major)
    * 3♥️! Maximum with a singleton, no void or long side suit
        * 3♠️! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    * 3♠️! Maximum with a void
        * 3NT! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    * 3NT! Maximum with no singleton, void, or long side suit
    * 4♣️! Maximum, 5+ card club suit
    * 4♦️! Maximum, 5+ card diamond suit
    * 4♥️! Maximum, 5+ cards in the other major
* 2♠️!/3♥️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values with the suit bid.
* 3♣️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
* 3♦️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
* 3♥️!/3♠️! Preemptive raise. Less than invitational with 4+ card support.
* 4♥️!/4♠️! To play, no slam interest.

## After 3NT! (Gambling)

* 4♣️ Pass or correct to 4♦️

* X is penalty

# Over Interference

## Direct interference over 1♣️!

Because there will be a wide variety of styles of interference, both natural and
artificial, we will avoid ascribing any artificial meaning to bids that would
show the same suits as the opponents, with the understanding that it is unlikely
that we will want to make such a bid.

### Over 1X (or Double)

* Pass! 0-4
* X!/XX! 5-7 "semipositive"
* All others natural and game forcing

### Over 2X

* All non-jump bids transfer to next higher suit, including double
* Opener will generally accept the transfer with the following exceptions
    * Jumping in the transfered-to suit shows a very strong hand (wanting to
      play game across a random semipositive hand).
    * Bidding another suit shows 0-1 cards in the transfer suit and a good
      alternative suit (5 cards at worst, ideally a good 6).
    * Bidding a suit instead of accepting a transfer to no trump shows a
      distributional hand with the suit bid.
    * Jumping in another suit shows both a very strong hand and lack of support.
* Responder continuing after any of these rebids is game forcing.

Because the 1♣️ opener could have any distribution, transfers with a weak hand
should generally have at least a 6 card suit. However, if responder transfers
and then continues with a game forcing auction, it may be only 5 cards, and
opener should be sure to show real support after accepting the transfer if they
have 3.

Example: After 1♣️!-(2♥️)

* X! Transfer to spades
* 2♠️! Transfer to no trump
* 2NT! Transfer to clubs
* 3♣️! Transfer to diamonds
* 3♦️! Transfer to hearts

### Over 3X and higher

* All bids are natural and game forcing
* Double is game forcing values without clear direction, more penalty oriented
  at higher levels

## After 1M-(?)

* 2M support can be less than invitational
* Jump raise is preemptive

# Defensive Conventions

## Defense against 1NT

Here "single suit" means 6+ cards, two suiter means 5-4 or better.

### Against strong (ranges that are always 14 or higher)

* X! Either single suit minor or both majors
    * 2♣️ Forced
        * Pass 6+♣️s
        * 2♦️ 6+♦️s
        * 2♥️ Both majors, pass or correct to 2♠️
* 2♣️! Clubs and a major
    * 2♦️! Ask for major
* 2♦️! Diamonds and a major
    * 2♥️ Pass or correct to 2♠️
* 2♥️ 6+♥️s
* 2♠️ 6+♠️s
* 2NT! Both minors, generally 5/5 or better

### Against weak (13 or lower included in the range) - WORK IN PROGRESS

* X! 14+ points, can be passed for penalty
* 2♣️! Spades and either hearts or clubs
* 2♦️! Diamonds and a major
* 2♥️ 6+♥️s
* 2♠️ 6+♠️s

# Bidding during game forcing auctions

* Until agreement about denomination, non-jump bids are natural
* Jump bids are splinters, showing a singleton or void in the suit bid and
  implicitly agreeing the last denomination bid.
* After agreement, bids are:
    * Reasonable games are to play or choice of games. A game is reasonable if
      it is 3NT, the suit agreed, or in a suit that was previously bid naturally
      by the other player. Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, the reasonable games are
      3NT, 4♥️, and 5♣️.
        * 4NT is generally keycard and not an offer to play
        * If hearts or spades was bid naturally, then 5♥️/5♠️ is generally an
          offer to play if the auction is already passed the corresponding 4
          level game.
    * If a captain is not established, the next bid is SRAAACA (see below), and
      the other player becomes captain.
    * If a captain is established (Responder after any non-1♣️ opening, opener if
      responder made a positive response to 1♣️ as a passed hand), then:
        * A bid by the non-captain is a cue bid, showing a 1st or 2nd round
          control in the suit bid, and denying such controls that could have
          been shown with cheaper bids. A notrump bid denies all controls that
          could have been shown with a cheaper bid.
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-2♦️-2♥️, responder is captain but opener is to
              bid, so they start with a cue bid after which responder can make
              asking bids.
        * A bid by the captain is asking about the non-captain's holding in the
          suit bid, with the following steps:
            * Step 1: No help (xx or worse)
            * Step 2: Unreliable second round control e.g. Kx
            * Step 3: Reliable second round control e.g. KQx
            * Step 4: Singleton (not ace)
            * Step 5: Ace
            * Step 6: Void
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, 3♦️! asks about diamonds with 3♥️! being
              step 1, 3♠️ being step 2, 3NT being step 3, and so on.
        * If the asking bid suit was previously bid naturally by the player
          being asked, the scale is different (note: the bid must be below game,
          otherwise it is a reasonable game and therefore an offer to play).
            * Step 1: No top honors (A/K/Q)
            * Step 2: One top honor
            * Step 3: Two top honors
            * Step 4: Three top honors
            * Step 5: Three top honors and 6+ cards
* Doubles are penalty

## SRAAACA (pronounced like Sriracha)

The name stands for "Strength Response After Agreement in Ambiguous Captain
Auctions". If both sides are unlimited during a game forcing auction (only
positive responses by a non-passed hand after 1♣️ opening) and agreement occurs
below game level, the next bid defines the strength of the hand and the hand
that created the agreement becomes the captain.

Responses are overlapping 3-point intervals spaced 2 apart. Judgment should be
used to decide whether to show borderline hands in the higher or lower range.

Example: After 1♣️-1♥️-2♥️, responder is 8+ so the steps are

* 2♠️! 8-10
* 2NT! 10-12
* 3♣️! 12-14
* 3♦️! 14-16
* And so on

Example 2: After 1♣️-1♥️-1♠️-2♠️, opener is 16+ so the steps are

* 2NT! 16-18
* 3♣️! 18-20
* 3♦️! 20-22
* 3♥️! 22-24
* And so on

Exception: If agreement was made by a splinter, it is better for the hand
opposite the shown shortness to be captain for better bidding accuracy. Relaying
asks for strength, other bids outside the trump suit are directly asking about
help in that suit, and notrump asks for a cue bid (4NT remains keycard). An ask
in the splinter suit is for clarity on the shortness, whether immediately or
after a relay for strength.

When shortness is shown, 3NT is no longer considered an offer to play.

Example 3: After 1♣️!-1♥️-3♦️!

* 3♥️! Asks for strength
    * 3♠️! 16-18
    * 3NT! 18-20
    * And so on
* 3♠️! Asks about spade holding
* 3NT! Demands cue bid
* 4♣️! Asks about club holding
* 4♦️! Asks about shortness
    * 4♥️! Singleton
    * 4♠️! Void

If the splintering player is already limited, then the strength relay is
just a regular asking bid.

Example 4: After P-1♣️!-1♥️-1♠️-3♣️!, note that the initial pass limits responder to 8-10.

* 3♦️! Asks about diamond holding
* 3♥️! Asks about heart holding
* 3NT! Demands cue bid
* 4♣️! Asks about shortness
    * 4♦️! Singleton
    * 4♥️! Void
* 4♠️ Signoff

# Miscellaneous

* RKC 1430
    * Jump to 4NT after a suit-showing bid without an agreed denomination
      implicitly agrees the suit just shown.
    * After response:
        * Next step other than the trump suit is queen ask
            * Cheapest trump bid = no queen
            * Others = queen + king in shown suit
            * Notrump = queen + no outside king
        * 5NT is king ask, guarantees all relevant key cards
            * Responder bids cheapest king. A higher suit below the agreed trump
              can then be bid to ask responder to bid 7 with that king.
        * Directly bidding 6 of a suit lower than trump asks responder to bid 7
          with the queen of that suit and 6 otherwise. If space permits,
          responder may bid 6 of a higher suit still below the trump suit to
          deny the asked queen but show another queen.
    * DOPI over interference (Double = 0 or 3, Pass = 1 or 4, Step = 2 or 5 w/o
      queen, 2 steps = 2 or 5 w/ queen, assuming space permits)
