# Guiding Principles

* Open light. Bidding is more fun than not bidding, and also comes with
  some preemptive benefits. Even playing standard, 11 point hands sometimes get
  upgraded to pretend to be a 13 count. We just systematically open them.
  * However, light is not trash. E.g. 10 point balanced hand is not worth an upgrade.
* Establish a captain of the auction quickly. For openings other than 1♣️,
  responder is immediately the captain as opener's range is limited.
  * If the auction goes P-1♣️-positive response, then responder is known to be
    8-10 and therefore opener is captain.
  * For 1♣️-positive response from nonpassed hands, we have an agreement called
    SRAAACA to define the range of one of the hands.
* Play partscores two levels below game when possible. For example, 3♥️ is really
  only a good place to be when you're making exactly 9 tricks. The effect of
  this can be seen in the invite sequences. For example, 2♣️-2♦️-2♥️ implies a
  minimum so that we don't need to continue to the 3 level when responder is
  invitational (opener would be 3♥️ instead with a maximum).
  * This does not apply for preemptive bids
* Game force early to have plenty of bidding space for finding the right game or
  slam.
  * Note: That bidding space is not particularly well used yet.
* Be Basic Chart legal. Both partners are significantly below 750 masterpoints
  and we don't want to practice a Basic+ system just to need to switch when
  playing at events with low limits.

# Notation

Throughout the document, a ! next to a bid means it's alertable. A \* indicates
that it would carry an announcement. Alerts at 4 level and higher starting with
opener's rebid are delayed alerts instead.

# Openings

* 1♣️! 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced (except 2NT opening hands)
* 1♦️\* Good 10-15 catchall (always 3+♦️s or balanced, always 2+♦️s), can be a
  balanced 16 in 1st or 2nd seat nonvul, as 1NT is 10-12 in those seats.
* 1♥️ Good 10-15 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ Good 10-15 5+♠️s
* 1NT\*
    * In first and second seat nonvulnerable, 10-12 balanced, maybe bad 13s.
      ABSOLUTELY NO UPGRADES OF NINE POINT HANDS (Illegal in ACBL events).
    * In all other situations, 14-16 balanced.
    * Balanced hands including 5 card majors are opened 1NT if they are in the
      appropriate point range.
* 2♣️! Good 10-15 6+♣️s

  or less)

## Notrump ranges

For quick reference, this is our "Notrump ladder". Systems are generally on in
all cases, but for the 2NT bids we use Puppet Stayman.

* 11-13 1♦️\*-1M-1NT (1NT if 1st/2nd nonvul)
* 14-16 1NT\* (1♦️\*-1M-1NT if 1st/2nd nonvul)
* 17-19 1♣️!-1♦️!-1NT
* 20-21 2NT
* 22-23 1♣️!-1♦️!-2NT
* 24-25 1♣️!-1♦️!-2♥️!-2♠️!-2NT
* 26-27 1♣️!-1♦️!-3NT
* 28+ 1♣️!-1♦️!-2♥️!-2♠️!-3NT

# Responses

        * 2♠️! Essentially forced
            * 2NT 24-25 balanced, systems on
            * 3♣️ 22+ 5+♥️s, 4+♣️, forcing
            * 3♦️ 22+ 5+♥️s, 4+♦️, forcing
            * 3♥️ 22+ 6+♥️s, forcing

    * 3♦️ 22+ 4+♦️s, forcing
    * 3NT 26-27 balanced, stayman and transfers available
* 1♥️ 8+ 5+♥️s
* 1♠️ 8+ 5+♠️s
* 1NT! 8-11 or 14+ balanced. After this opening, the first SRAAACA range is
  8-9, then 10-11, then 14-16, etc.
    * 2♣️! Asks for 4 card major. To keep auctions lower, use transfer responses:
        * 2♦️! 4♥️s
        * 2♥️! 4♠️s
        * 2♠️! No 4 card major
            * 2NT "sets" notrump and asks for SRAAACA.
        * Opener can complete the transfer to confirm the fit, which initiates
          SRAAACA, or bid another suit naturally to ask for support.
* 2♣️ 8+ 5+♣️s
* 2♦️ 8+ 5+♦️s
* 2♥️! 8+ 4441 singleton heart
    * After any of the 4441 responses, a bid below game by opener creates
      agreement on the strain and responder will bid according to SRAAACA.
* 2♠️! 8+ 4441 singleton spade
* 2NT! 12-13 balanced
    * 3♣️! Asks for 4 card major. Similar to the 1NT response, use
      transfer respones here as well.
        * 3♦️! 4♥️s
        * 3♥️! 4♠️s
        * 3♠️! No 4 card major
        * Completing the transfer at 3 level shows slam interest. Opener should
          jump to game with minimum hands and a fit.
* 3♣️! 8+ 4441 singleton club
* 3♦️! 8+ 4441 singleton diamond

## After 1♦️\*

* 1♥️ 4+♥️s, one round forcing. With 4/4 spades and hearts and less than game
  forcing values, responder typically starts with 1♥️.
    * 1♠️ 4♠️s, possibly balanced
        * 2-way checkback is on
        * 2♠️ General invite with 4♠️s
        * Bids above 2♠️ are game tries with a spade fit, with the same meaning
          as if the bidding started 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️.
    * 1NT 11-13 balanced, denies 4♠️s
    * 2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    * 2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
    * 2♥️ 4♥️s any strength
* 1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing.
    * 1NT 11-13 balanced
    * 2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    * 2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
    * 2♥️! Exactly 3=4=5=1, any strength
        * 2NT! Artificial invitational+ asking bid
            * 3♣️! Any minimum
            * 3♦️!, 3♥️!, 3♠️!, 3NT! Maximum with ace or king in suit bid (or clubs
              if NT) and none of the cheaper ones.
    * 2♠️ 4♠️s any strength
* 1NT Nonforcing
* 2♣️! 11+ points, 5+♣️s. Generally denies a 4 card major unless game forcing values. Somewhat artificial rebids:
    * 2♦️! Any minimum without 4♥️s
        * 2♥️! Artificial game force, asks for clarification.
            * Opener continus by bidding shape naturally.
        * 2♠️ Nonforcing, 4♠️s
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s 
        * 3♦️ Signoff
        * 3♥️! 6+♣️s, 5+♥️s, slam seeking
        * 3♠️!, 6+♣️s, 5+♠️s, slam seeking
        * 3NT Signoff
    * 2♥️! Minimum with 4♥️s
        * Pass To play
        * 2♠️! Artificial game force
            * Opener continues bidding naturally.
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️, Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        * 3♦️ Signoff
        * 3♥️ Invitation to 4♥️, looking for good minimums
    * 2♠️! Maximum, 4♠️s
    * 2NT! Maximum, natural
    * 3♣️! Maximum, 4+♣️s
    * 3♦️! Maximum, 6+♦️s
    * 3♥️! Maximum, 4♥️s
    * After maximum responses, the auction is forcing to game and continuations
      are natural. If responder confirms a fit below game level that implies
      slam interest (fast arrival).
* 2♦️! 11+ points, 5+♦️s, similar rebids as after 2♣️:
    * 2♥️! Any minimum
        * 2♠️! Artificial game force
            * Opener continues bidding shape naturally
        * 2NT Nonforcing, natural
        * 3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        * 3♦️ Signoff
    * Others are maximum and natural, with natural continuations.
    * Since opener won't show a 4 card major unless responder game forces, it
      will usually be better to bid 1♥️ or 1♠️ with a 4 card major and without
      slam interest. On the other hand, when responder does have slam interest,
      2♦️ will make it easier to find a good diamond fit if it exists.
* 2♥️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long hearts
* 2♠️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long spades
* 2NT Balanced, invitational to game
* 3♣️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs
* 3♦️! Preemptive raise
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* After a 1♦️-1M-1NT sequence showing 11-13 balanced,
  [2 way checkback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_RD8ycgRT8) is on
    * 2♣️! Weak with diamonds or various invitational hands
        * 2♦️! Forced relay, then responder clarifies
            * Pass Weak with diamonds
            * 2M Invitational with 5+M
            * 2OM Invitational with 4+OM
    * 2♦️! Artificial game forcing. Natural continuations, favoring lowest bids.
        * 2M 3 card support
        * 2OM 4 card unbid major
    * 2M Pulling for partscore, less than invitational values
    * 2♥️ (after 1♦️-1♠️-1NT) Nonforcing, 5+♠️, 4+♥️, longer spades
    * 2NT! Transfer to clubs
    * 3M Game forcing with 6+ cards, at least mild slam interest
    * 4M To play, generally 6+ cards, no slam interest.
* Checkback also applies after 1♦️-1♥️-1♠️, with one addition
    * 1NT Nonforcing and less than invitational. With a hand unsuitable for
      playing 1NT, opener bids 2♣️ with a minor two-suiter or 2♦️ with long
      diamonds.
* After 1♦️-1♥️-2m, opener has shown an unbalanced hand and denied 4 spades.
  Responder's 2♠️ bid is an artifical game force, and opener should continue to
  describe their hand, especially showing 3 card support for a major,
  prioritizing hearts.
* After 1♦️-1M-2M, Kokish game tries are available for invitational hands, but
  generally discouraged as they give a significant amount of information to the
  defense. Despite being called game tries, they may also be used to investigate
  slam as opener is forced to bid whether they are accepting or not.
    * Next step (1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified help suit game try.
        * Opener bids the cheapest suit where they have help (generally first or
          second round control). If the auction was 1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows
          the spade help and is considered the cheapest. Afterward, responder
          can sign off in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another suit asking opener to
          bid game if they have a first or second control in that suit.
        * Opener is also free to bid game directly if they have help in every
          suit or maximal values.
    * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
        * Opener reevaluates their hand in the context of shortness and decides
          whether to bid game or not. Maximal hands may choose to play game even
          with wasted values.

## After 1♥️/1♠️

* 1♥️-1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
    * After 1♥️-1♠️-1NT, 2 way checkback is on with similar structure as after
      1♦️-1M-1NT
* 1NT\* Semiforcing. Opener may pass with 11-13 balanced or semibalanced, bids 4
  card side suit or rebids 6 card major otherwise. A side suit bid of 2♠️ should
  only be made with either near-max values or 6/5+ distribution (minimum 5/5
  hands would open 1♠️).
* 2/1 responses are game forcing and natural
  * 2♣️ is either 5+♣️s or any balanced. All other bids are 5+ in that suit.
  * 1M-2m-2NT shows a balanced hand with no 4 card side suit. New suits from
    opener ask for help; bid 3NT if responder has a stop in that suit, otherwise
    continue naturally.
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* 2♥️/2♠️ Invitational with 3+ card support
    * Opener generally passes or bids 4♥️/4♠️ directly. For borderline hands,
      Kokish game tries are available (description below). However, they are
      discouraged as they will often be more valuable tips for the defense than
      value for us finding the right contract.
        * Next step (1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified help suit game try.
            * Responder bids the cheapest suit where they have help (generally
              first or second round control). If the auction was 1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then
              2NT! shows the spade control and is considered the cheapest.
              Afterward, opener can sign off in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another
              suit asking responder to bid game if they have a first or second
              control in that suit.
        * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
            * Responder bids 4♥️/4♠️ if they do not have wasted values in the suit
              bid, and 3♥️/3♠️ otherwise.
* 2NT! Game forcing raise with 4+ card support, slam seeking.
    * 3♣️! Minimum without a void
        * 3♦️! Asks (Compare these responses to the immediate response to 2NT with
          a max)
            * 3♥️! Singleton, no long side suit
                * 3♠️! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
            * 3♠️ Unused
            * 3NT! No singleton or long side suit
            * 4♣️! 5+ card club suit
            * 4♦️! 5+ card diamond suit
            * 4♥️! 5+ cards in the other major
    * 3♦️! Minimum with a void
        * 3♥️! Asks where (use 3♠️! for the other major)
    * 3♥️! Maximum with a singleton, no void or long side suit
        * 3♠️! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    * 3♠️! Maximum with a void
        * 3NT! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    * 3NT! Maximum with no singleton, void, or long side suit
    * 4♣️! Maximum, 5+ card club suit
    * 4♦️! Maximum, 5+ card diamond suit
    * 4♥️! Maximum, 5+ cards in the other major
* 2♠️!/3♥️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values with the suit bid.
* 3♣️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
* 3♦️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
* 3♥️!/3♠️! Preemptive raise. Less than invitational with 4+ card support.
* 4♥️!/4♠️! To play, no slam interest.

## After 10-12 1NT

* 2♣️ Stayman. The same weak hands are allowed as over the 14-16 1NT. With these
  weak hands you can also consider waiting for opponents to double and then
  utilize the runout system.
* 2♦️! Game forcing relay. Opener describes their exact shape via a sequence of
  bids. Responder can bid a game to sign off at any time. The general pattern is
  for responder to bid the major they don't have, then disambiguate 4 cards or 5
  cards, and then bid their doubleton, with the nearby bids filling in for
  doubletons that would take too much space to bid directly.
    * 2♥️! 4+♠️s, 3-♥️s, includes 4=3=3=3
        * 2♠️! Relay
            * 2NT! 5♠️s
                * 3♣️! Relay
                    * 3♦️! 5=3=2=3 (diamond doubleton)
                    * 3♥️! 5=2=3=3 (heart doubleton)
                    * 3♠️! 5=3=3=2 (black doubleton)
            * 3♣️! 4=3=4=2 (club doubleton)
            * 3♦️! 4=3=2=4 (diamond doubleton)
            * 3♥️! 4=2=3=4 (major doubleton, numeric order to show the minors)
            * 3♠️! 4=2=4=3 (major doubleton, numeric order to show the minors)
            * 3NT! 4=3=3=3 (totally flat)
    * 2♠️! 4+♥️s, 3-♠️s, excludes 3=4=3=3
        * 2NT! Relay
            * 3♣️! 5+♥️s
                * 3♦️! Relay
                    * 3♥️! 3=5=2=3 (red doubleton)
                    * 3♠️! 2=5=3=3 (spade doubleton)
                    * 3NT! 3=5=3=2 (club doubleton)
            * 3♦️! 3=4=2=4 (diamond doubleton)
            * 3♥️! 2=4=3=4 (major doubleton, numeric order to show the minors)
            * 3♠️! 2=4=4=3 (major doubleton, numeric order to show the minors)
            * 3NT! 3=4=4=2 (club doubleton)
    * 2NT! 4=4 majors or 4=4 minors
        * 3♣️! Relay
            * 3♦️! 4=4=2=3 (diamond doubleton)
            * 3♥️! 3=2=4=4 (heart doubleton)
            * 3♠️! 2=3=4=4 (spade doubleton)
            * 3NT! 4=4=3=2 (club doubleton)
    * 3♣️! (4333) with the 4 in ♦️ or ♥️
        * 3♦️! Relay
            * 3♥️! 3=3=4=3 (don't bid hearts when you have them)
            * 3♠️! 3=4=3=3
    * 3♦️! 3=3=3=4
    * 3♥️! 2=2=4=5
    * 3♠️! 2=2=5=4
    * After opener has shown their shape, a responder interested in slam may bid
      the cheapest bid (or 4♣️ if the cheapest bid would be 3NT) to ask for
      controls (A=2, K=1):
        * Step 1: 0 controls
        * Step 2: 1 control
        * Step 3: 2 controls
        * etc
    * If the opponents double 2♦️, relays are on and redouble is an attempt to
      cash in.
    * Relays are off over any other interference over 2♦️. Doubles are penalty as
      usual for game forcing auctions.
    * If you've chosen to open a (24)(25) hand 1NT, show the major doubleton and
      bid as if it's (24)(34) accordingly.
* 2♥️ To play
* 2♠️ To play
* 2NT! Weak with both minors
* 3♣️!/3♦️!/3♥️!/3♠️! Preemptive natural
* 3NT To play
* 4♣️! Texas transfer to hearts
* 4♦️! Texas transfer to spades
* 4♥️ To play
* 4♠️ To play
* 4NT Quantitative invite to slam
* 5♣️ To play
* 5♦️ To play

### Runouts after 1NT-X or 1NT-P-P-X-P-P

Over a double, runouts are akin to our strong notrump defense.
Runouts are on regardless of whether the double is meant as penalty or not.

* Pass Suggests playing 1NTx
* XX Relays to 2♣️ showing either a single minor or both majors
* 2♣️ Clubs and a higher suit (Note: In the defense this is clubs and a major,
  but we would rather not force ourselves to run to 3 level with both minors).
* 2♦️ Diamonds and a higher suit
* 2♥️ Natural, to play
* 2♠️ Natural, to play

Any continuation by responder after the natural conclusion of the runout shows
at least invitational values and is forcing. Any suit bid by opener other than
the cheapest one shows a good 5 card suit suggesting to play there rather than
looking for a fit in one of responder's suits.

## After 14-16 1NT or 1♣️!-1♦️!-1NT

* 2♣️ Stayman
    * Could be several hand types, but always includes a 4 card major:
        * Garbage stayman (3 suited hand with short clubs)
        * Crawling stayman (weak hand with both majors)
        * Weak hand with a 4 card major and a long (probably 6) card minor
        * With invitational and 5/4 majors instead start by transferring to the
          5 card major.
    * 2♦️ No 4+ card major
        * Pass Garbage stayman or weak with a major and long ♦️s
        * 2♥️ Crawling stayman - weak with both majors
        * 3♣️! Signoff - weak with a 4 card major and long ♣️s
        * 3♥️! Smolen - Game forcing with 5♠️s and 4♥️s
        * 3♠️! Smolen - Game forcing with 5♥️s and 4♠️s
    * 2♥️ 4+♥️s, could have 4♠️s
        * 2♠️! Nonforcing, shows the weak hand with 4♠️s and a long minor
        * 2NT Invitational without heart fit (implies a 4 card ♠️ suit)
        * 3♥️ Invitational with a heart fit. Opener can bid 3NT to accept if they
          want to offer a choice of games.
        * 3♠️! Slam try in ♥️s
    * 2♠️ 4+♠️s, denies 4♥️s
        * 2NT Invitational without spade fit (implies a 4 card ♥️ suit)
        * 3♣️! Signoff - Weak with 4♥️s and long ♣️s

    * 3♦️! 4=3=1=5
        * 3♥️! Asks opener to bid 3♠️! with a minimum, cheapest cue bid of an ace

* 2NT! and 3♦️! are ON in competition.

## After 2♥️/2♠️

Here M refers to the opened major and X refers to any other suit. A feature
is generally an ace or king, and never shortage. The meanings of maximum and
minimum are left unspecified, but adding a king to a maximum should take it
outside of the preempt range, either to pass in hopes of a better constructive
auction or to a one level opening.

* New suits natural and forcing
* 2NT! Artificial inquiry, invitational or better. Note that because of the light
  preempting style, an invitational hand needs to be quite strong. This can also
  be used for investigating slam and is often better suited for that purpose as
  you can safely sign off in 4M after any sequence of bids.
    * 3♣️! Any minimum
        * 3♦️! Asks for more clarification
            * 3M! Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature
            * 3X! 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
        * 3M Signoff
        * 4M Signoff
    * 3M! Maximum, Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature and
      generally has a shortage.
    * 3X! Maximum, 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
    * 3NT! Maximum, 6 card suit and no outside feature. If vulnerable, also
      denies shortage.
* 2NT is ON in competition if available.

## After 2NT or 1♣️!-1♦️!-2NT

* 3♣️! Game forcing puppet stayman
    * 3♦️! No 5 card major, have 4 card major
        * 3♥️! Is the major spades?
            * 3NT No
            * 3♠️ Yes
        * 3♠️! Is the major hearts?
            * 3NT No
            * 4♥️ Yes
    * 3♥️ 5♥️s
    * 3♠️ 5♠️s
    * 3NT! No 4 or 5 card major
        * 4♣️! Transfer to ♥️ (made with unusual lengths such as 6/4 in majors)
        * 4♦️! Transfer to ♠️ (made with unusual lengths such as 6/4 in majors)
        * 4♥️ To play (made with unusal lengths and desire to declare)
        * 4♠️ To play (made with unusal lengths and desire to declare)

* 3♥️\* Jacoby transfer to ♠️
* 3NT To play
* 4♣️\* Texas transfer to ♥️
* 4♦️\* Texas transfer to ♠️
* 4♥️ To play
* 4♠️ To play

## After 3NT! (Gambling)

* 4♣️ Pass or correct to 4♦️

## After 3+ level preempts from our side

* X is penalty

# Over Interference

## Direct interference over 1♣️!

Because there will be a wide variety of styles of interference, both natural and
artificial, we will avoid ascribing any artificial meaning to bids that would
show the same suits as the opponents, with the understanding that it is unlikely
that we will want to make such a bid.

### Over 1X (or Double)

* Pass! 0-4
* X!/XX! 5-7 "semipositive"
* All others natural and game forcing

### Over 2X

* All non-jump bids transfer to next higher suit, including double
* Opener will generally accept the transfer with the following exceptions
    * Jumping in the transfered-to suit shows a very strong hand (wanting to
      play game across a random semipositive hand).
    * Bidding another suit shows 0-1 cards in the transfer suit and a good
      alternative suit (5 cards at worst, ideally a good 6).
    * Bidding a suit instead of accepting a transfer to no trump shows a
      distributional hand with the suit bid.
    * Jumping in another suit shows both a very strong hand and lack of support.
* Responder continuing after any of these rebids is game forcing.

Because the 1♣️ opener could have any distribution, transfers with a weak hand
should generally have at least a 6 card suit. However, if responder transfers
and then continues with a game forcing auction, it may be only 5 cards, and
opener should be sure to show real support after accepting the transfer if they
have 3.

Example: After 1♣️!-(2♥️)

* X! Transfer to spades
* 2♠️! Transfer to no trump
* 2NT! Transfer to clubs
* 3♣️! Transfer to diamonds
* 3♦️! Transfer to hearts

### Over 3X and higher

* All bids are natural and game forcing
* Double is game forcing values without clear direction, more penalty oriented
  at higher levels

## After 1M-(?)

* 2M support can be less than invitational
* Jump raise is preemptive

# Defensive Conventions

## Defense against 1NT

Here "single suit" means 6+ cards, two suiter means 5-4 or better.

### Against strong (ranges that are always 14 or higher)

* X! Either single suit minor or both majors
    * 2♣️ Forced
        * Pass 6+♣️s
        * 2♦️ 6+♦️s
        * 2♥️ Both majors, pass or correct to 2♠️
* 2♣️! Clubs and a major
    * 2♦️! Ask for major
* 2♦️! Diamonds and a major
    * 2♥️ Pass or correct to 2♠️
* 2♥️ Natural (5+♥️s)
* 2♠️ Natural (5+♠️s)
* 2NT! Both minors, generally 5/5 or better

### Against weak (13 or lower included in the range)

* X! Good hand, penalty oriented
* 2♣️ Natural
* 2♦️ Natural
* 2♥️ Natural
* 2♠️ Natural

# Bidding during game forcing auctions

* Until agreement about denomination, non-jump bids are natural
* Jump bids are splinters, showing a singleton or void in the suit bid and
  implicitly agreeing the last denomination bid.
* After agreement, bids are:
    * Reasonable games are to play or choice of games. A game is reasonable if
      it is 3NT, the suit agreed, or in a suit that was previously bid naturally
      by the other player. Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, the reasonable games are
      3NT, 4♥️, and 5♣️.
        * 4NT is generally keycard and not an offer to play
        * If hearts or spades was bid naturally, then 5♥️/5♠️ is generally an
          offer to play if the auction is already passed the corresponding 4
          level game.
    * If a captain is not established, the next bid is SRAAACA (see below), and
      the other player becomes captain.
    * If a captain is established (Responder after any non-1♣️ opening, opener if
      responder made a positive response to 1♣️ as a passed hand), then:
        * A bid by the non-captain is a cue bid, showing a 1st or 2nd round
          control in the suit bid, and denying such controls that could have
          been shown with cheaper bids. A notrump bid denies all controls that
          could have been shown with a cheaper bid.
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-2♦️-2♥️, responder is captain but opener is to
              bid, so they start with a cue bid after which responder can make
              asking bids.
        * A bid by the captain is asking about the non-captain's holding in the
          suit bid, with the following steps:
            * Step 1: No help (xx or worse)
            * Step 2: Unreliable second round control e.g. Kx
            * Step 3: Reliable second round control e.g. KQx
            * Step 4: Singleton (not ace)
            * Step 5: Ace
            * Step 6: Void
            * Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, 3♦️! asks about diamonds with 3♥️! being
              step 1, 3♠️ being step 2, 3NT being step 3, and so on.
        * If the asking bid suit was previously bid naturally by the player
          being asked, the scale is different (note: the bid must be below game,
          otherwise it is a reasonable game and therefore an offer to play).
            * Step 1: No top honors (A/K/Q)
            * Step 2: One top honor
            * Step 3: Two top honors
            * Step 4: Three top honors
            * Step 5: Three top honors and 6+ cards
* Doubles are penalty

## SRAAACA (pronounced like Sriracha)

The name stands for "Strength Response After Agreement in Ambiguous Captain
Auctions". If both sides are unlimited during a game forcing auction (only
positive responses by a non-passed hand after 1♣️ opening) and agreement occurs
below game level, the next bid defines the strength of the hand and the hand
that created the agreement becomes the captain.

Responses are overlapping 3-point intervals spaced 2 apart. Judgment should be
used to decide whether to show borderline hands in the higher or lower range.

Example: After 1♣️-1♥️-2♥️, responder is 8+ so the steps are

* 2♠️! 8-10
* 2NT! 10-12
* 3♣️! 12-14
* 3♦️! 14-16
* And so on

Example 2: After 1♣️-1♥️-1♠️-2♠️, opener is 16+ so the steps are

* 2NT! 16-18
* 3♣️! 18-20
* 3♦️! 20-22
* 3♥️! 22-24
* And so on

Exception: If agreement was made by a splinter, it is better for the hand
opposite the shown shortness to be captain for better bidding accuracy. Relaying
asks for strength, other bids outside the trump suit are directly asking about
help in that suit, and notrump asks for a cue bid (4NT remains keycard). An ask
in the splinter suit is for clarity on the shortness, whether immediately or
after a relay for strength.

When shortness is shown, 3NT is no longer considered an offer to play.

Example 3: After 1♣️!-1♥️-3♦️!

* 3♥️! Asks for strength
    * 3♠️! 16-18
    * 3NT! 18-20
    * And so on
* 3♠️! Asks about spade holding
* 3NT! Demands cue bid
* 4♣️! Asks about club holding
* 4♦️! Asks about shortness
    * 4♥️! Singleton
    * 4♠️! Void

If the splintering player is already limited, then the strength relay is
just a regular asking bid.

Example 4: After P-1♣️!-1♥️-1♠️-3♣️!, note that the initial pass limits responder to 8-10.

* 3♦️! Asks about diamond holding
* 3♥️! Asks about heart holding
* 3NT! Demands cue bid
* 4♣️! Asks about shortness
    * 4♦️! Singleton
    * 4♥️! Void
* 4♠️ Signoff

# Miscellaneous

* RKC 1430
    * Jump to 4NT after a suit-showing bid without an agreed denomination
      implicitly agrees the suit just shown.
    * After response:
        * Next step other than the trump suit is queen ask
            * Cheapest trump bid = no queen
            * Others = queen + king in shown suit
            * Notrump = queen + no outside king
        * 5NT is king ask, guarantees all relevant key cards
            * Responder bids cheapest king. A higher suit below the agreed trump
              can then be bid to ask responder to bid 7 with that king.
        * Directly bidding 6 of a suit lower than trump asks responder to bid 7
          with the queen of that suit and 6 otherwise. If space permits,
          responder may bid 6 of a higher suit still below the trump suit to
          deny the asked queen but show another queen.
    * DOPI over interference (Double = 0 or 3, Pass = 1 or 4, Step = 2 or 5 w/o
      queen, 2 steps = 2 or 5 w/ queen, assuming space permits)
* Exclusion Keycard
    * Jump to 5 of a suit shows a void in that suit and asks for keycards
      outside.
    * Responses are in steps:
        * First step 0 outside keycards
        * Second step 1 outside keycard without the trump queen
        * Third step 1 outside keycard with the trump queen
        * Fourth step 2 outside keycards without the trump queen
        * Fifth step 2 outside keycards with the trump queen
    * 3 keycards doesn't need a response because initiator will need to have one
      or else the 2 keycard response takes the auction too high.

## Lebensohl

### After a direct 2-level overcall of our 1NT opening

If the opponents overcall 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️ directly over our 1NT opening (systems
are on over 2♣️), regardless of which range, 2NT by responder is a relay to 3♣️ to
show a hand that is interested in competing to 3 level, but not interested in
investigating game (except in the case where responder continues by cue bidding
the opponent's suit). After the 3♣️ relay, responder either passes or bids their
suit naturally.

For suits above the overcalled suit, introducing the suit at two level is
nonforcing. Lebensohl can be used to show an invitational hand. Jumping to
three level shows a game force.

Cue bidding the opponent's suit is instead stayman, either showing a stopper in
the overcalled suit or not depending on whether the 2NT relay is used. The
direct cue bid denies a stopper ("fast denies"), while the relay and then cue
bidding shows a stopper ("slow shows").

Over a balancing overcall, responder has already passed, presumably denying game
interest, so Lebensohl does not apply.

Example situation: 1NT-(2♥️)-?
* 2♠️ Natural and nonforcing
* 2NT! Lebensohl
    * 3♣️! Forced
        * Pass Hand that wants to compete to 3♣️ but without game interest
        * 3♦️ Hand that wants to compete to 3♦️ but without game interest
        * 3♥️! "Stayman with a stopper", game forcing
        * 3♠️ Natural and invitational
* 3♣️ Natural and invitational
* 3♦️ Natural and invitational
* 3♥️! "Stayman without a stopper", game forcing
* 3♠️ Natural and game forcing
* 3NT To play

### After a takeout double of an opposing weak or intermediate 2

If the opponents open a weak or intermediate 2♣️, 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️, showing the suit
bid and our side doubles for takeout, 2NT is a relay to 3♣️ to show a weak hand
(generally 0-7).  Unlike in the previous situation, sometimes the doubler will
break the relay to show a very strong hand that has interest in going further
despite the 0-7 points.

Example situation: (2♥️)-X-?
* 2♠️ Natural and weak
* 2NT! Lebensohl, generally shows a weak hand
    * 3♣️! Nearly forced, shows that it was not a power double
        * Pass Wants to play 
        * 3♦️ Natural and weak
        * 3♥️! "Stayman with a stopper", game forcing
        * 3♠️ Natural and invitational
* 3♣️ Natural and invitational
* 3♦️ Natural and invitational
* 3♥️! "Stayman without a stopper", game forcing
* 3♠️ Natural and game forcing
* 3NT To play

## 3-suit Keycard

If opener has shown a 3-suited hand (for example, after a 2♦️ opening), then 4♣️,
4♦️, and 4NT are the keycard asks in the low, middle, and high suits
respectively, as long as none are needed as signoff bids. If some are signoff,
then the remaining bids are keycard for as many suits as possible, prioritizing
long suits, and higher suits between those of equal length. In all cases, the
cheaper bid corresponds to keycard in the lower suit.

When 3-suit keycard applies, the suit above the trump suit is the king asking
bid, with one very important exception. If not every suit was available to
keycard in, then a bid in the unavailable suit should be considered signoff
instead of king ask. The first available bid (possibly 5NT) is the king ask
instead. This allows the captain to keycard in another suit if they deem that
information to be good enough for finding slam in the unavailable suit. When
responding to the king ask, 5NT fills in as indicating the king of the suit used
to initiate the ask.

Example 1: After a 2♦️ opening, a direct response of 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️
is keycard in hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 2: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️ showing 3=4=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is not needed as
signoff (responder could pass), so 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in
hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 3: After 2♦️-2NT-3♦️ showing 4=3=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is a signoff
bid, so only 4♦️ and 4NT are keycard bids. In this case, hearts is the shortest
suit and therefore not given a keycard bid, so 4♦️ is keycard in clubs and 4NT is
keycard in spades.

Example 4: After 2♦️-2NT-3♠️ showing 4=4=1=4 and a maximum without the diamond A
or K, 4♣️ and 4♦️ are not needed as signoff as opener has shown a maximum after an
invitational bid. Therefore, 4♣️ is keycard in clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in hearts,
and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 5: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️-3♦️-3♥️ Showing 3=4=1=5 and a minimum, 4♣️ is a signoff
so 4♦️ is keycard in clubs and 4NT is keycard in hearts. After a response to 4NT,
5♠️ is a signoff indicating that responder had long spades, since it was
impossible to keycard in spades, and 5NT is instead the king ask.

## Doubles of an opponent's 1 minor opening

### Direct doubles of 1♣️ that contains weak (less than 15) options

This category includes standard 1♣️, Polish Club, "may be short" 1♣️ with transfer
responses, Tangerine Club, and so on. It also includes strong 1♣️ where the range
starts at 14 or lower, such as some versions of MOSCITO.

Double is a major-oriented takeout double. Power doubles are still included.
Most of the balanced hands that would open 1♦️ fall into this category, but you
should always have at least 4-3 in the majors. The exact point range is still to
be determined, but should not be much lighter than an opening. Responses are
similar to responding to a 1♦️ opening, but with an artificial negative response.
Alternatively, you can think about this as similar to responding to a Polish
Club.

* After (1♣️) X (P)
    * 1♦️ Usually 0-8 points, does not have a 4 card major if 7-8. Could be up to
      10 with a long minor that does not want to bid NT.
        * 1♥️ 4♥️s, may also have 4♠️s less than power double, nonforcing
        * 1♠️ 4♠️s without 4♥️s, less than power double, nonforcing
            * After these 1♥️ or 1♠️ bids, all bids are nonforcing, but both sides
              should be inclined to bid if at the top of their range.
        * 1NT 18-19 balanced
            * 1NT systems are on
        * 2♣️, 2♦️, 2♥️, 2♠️ Natural, power double strength
    * 1♥️ 7+ points, 4+♥️s, forcing
        * Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♥️, including 2 way checkback when
          applicable.
    * 1♠️ 7+ points, 4+♠️s, forcing, usually longer ♠️ than ♥️
        * Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♠️, including 2 way checkback when
          applicable.
    * 1NT 9-11 balanced
    * 2♣️ 11+ points, 5+♣️, forcing
        * Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♣️
    * 2♦️ 11+ points, 5+♦️, forcing
        * Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♦️
    * 2♥️ Weak, 6+♥️s
        * Opener should still continue bidding with power double strength.
    * 2♠️ Weak, 6+♠️s
        * Opener should still continue bidding with power double strength.
    * 2NT 12-13 balanced

### Doubles of a purely strong (always 15+) 1♣️ or 1♦️

This category includes Precision's 1♣️, Magic Diamond's 1♦️, and so on.

Double shows 4-4 or better in the majors. Compared to doubling a standard 1♣️,
the hand may be weaker. Because the opponents have made a strong opening, there
is no emphasis on finding a game, and more emphasis on preempting when possible.
This meaning also applies to doubling the artificial negative response (e.g.
against Precision, (1♣️) P (1♦️) X would be majors).

In addition, over these openings 1NT shows both minors (Mathe).

### Direct doubles of a natural 1♦️

This category includes standard 1♦️, especially those that are paired with a "may
be short" 1♣️ to guarantee 5. The original Precision 1♦️ also promised 4+, and
would fall into this category.

Double is takeout. However, there is still some major bias because it pays to be
aggressive with overcalling 2♣️ with 5, as it makes it significantly more
difficult for the opponents to find their 4-4 major fit.
