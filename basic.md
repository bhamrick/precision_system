# Guiding Principles

-   Open light. Bidding is more fun than not bidding, and also comes
    with some preemptive benefits. Even playing standard, 11 point hands
    sometimes get upgraded to pretend to be a 13 count. We just
    systematically open them.
    -   However, light is not trash. E.g. 10 point balanced hand is not
        worth an upgrade.
-   Establish a captain of the auction quickly. For openings other than
    1♣️, responder is immediately the captain as opener’s range is
    limited.
    -   If the auction goes P-1♣️-positive response, then responder is
        known to be 8-10 and therefore opener is captain.
    -   For 1♣️-positive response from nonpassed hands, we have an
        agreement called SRAAACA to define the range of one of the
        hands.
-   Play partscores two levels below game when possible. For example,
    3♥️ is really only a good place to be when you’re making exactly 9
    tricks. The effect of this can be seen in the invite sequences. For
    example, 2♣️-2♦️-2♥️ implies a minimum so that we don’t need to
    continue to the 3 level when responder is invitational (opener would
    be 3♥️ instead with a maximum).
    -   This does not apply for preemptive bids
-   Game force early to have plenty of bidding space for finding the
    right game or slam.
    -   Note: That bidding space is not particularly well used yet.
-   Be Basic Chart legal. Both partners are significantly below 750
    masterpoints and we don’t want to practice a Basic+ system just to
    need to switch when playing at events with low limits.

# Notation

Throughout the document, a ! next to a bid means it’s alertable. A \*
indicates that it would carry an announcement. Alerts at 4 level and
higher starting with opener’s rebid are delayed alerts instead.

# Openings

-   1♣️! 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced (except 2NT opening hands)
-   1♦️\* Good 10-15 catchall (always 3+♦️s or balanced, always 2+♦️s),
    can be a balanced 16 in 1st or 2nd seat nonvul, as 1NT is 11-13 in
    those seats.
-   1♥️ Good 10-15 5+♥️s
-   1♠️ Good 10-15 5+♠️s
-   1NT\*
    -   In first and second seat nonvulnerable, 11-13 balanced.
    -   In all other situations, 14-16 balanced.
    -   Balanced hands including 5 card majors are opened 1NT if they
        are in the appropriate point range.
-   2♣️! Good 10-15 6+♣️s
-   2♦️! Good 10-15, one of 3=4=1=5, 4=3=1=5, 4=4=0=5, or 4=4=1=4
-   2♥️ Weak, often 5 cards and/or very light when nonvulnerable.
-   2♠️ Weak, often 5 cards and/or very light when nonvulnerable.
-   2NT 20-21 balanced
-   3NT! Gambling (Solid 7 card minor suit e.g. AKQxxxx, minimum opening
    strength or less)

## Notrump ranges

For quick reference, this is our “Notrump ladder”. Systems are generally
on in all cases, but for the 2NT bids we use Puppet Stayman.

-   11-13 1♦️\*-1M-1NT (1NT if 1st/2nd nonvul)
-   14-16 1NT\* (1♦️\*-1M-1NT if 1st/2nd nonvul)
-   17-19 1♣️!-1♦️!-1NT
-   20-21 2NT
-   22-23 1♣️!-1♦️!-2NT
-   24-25 1♣️!-1♦️!-2♥️!-2♠️!-2NT
-   26-27 1♣️!-1♦️!-3NT
-   28+ 1♣️!-1♦️!-2♥️!-2♠️!-3NT

# After 1:clubs:!

-   1♦️! Negative 0-7, all other bids are game forcing
    -   1♥️ 16-21 5+♥️s, nonforcing
    -   1♠️ 16-21 5+♠️s, nonforcing
    -   1NT 17-19 balanced, systems on
    -   2♣️ 16-21 4+♣️s, nonforcing
    -   2♦️ 16-21 4+♦️s, nonforcing
    -   2♥️! 22+ 5+♥️s or various balanced ranges
        -   2♠️! Essentially forced
            -   2NT 24-25 balanced, systems on
            -   3♣️ 22+ 5+♥️s, 4+♣️, forcing
            -   3♦️ 22+ 5+♥️s, 4+♦️, forcing
            -   3♥️ 22+ 6+♥️s, forcing
            -   3♠️ 22+ 5+♥️, 4+♠️ with longer hearts, forcing
            -   3NT 28-29 balanced, stayman and transfers available
    -   2♠️ 22+ 5+♠️s, forcing
    -   2NT 22-23 balanced, nonforcing, systems on
    -   3♣️ 22+ 4+♣️s, forcing
    -   3♦️ 22+ 4+♦️s, forcing
    -   3NT 26-27 balanced, stayman and transfers available
-   1♥️ 8+ 5+♥️s
-   1♠️ 8+ 5+♠️s
-   1NT! 8-11 or 14+ balanced. After this opening, the first SRAAACA
    range is 8-9, then 10-11, then 14-16, etc.
    -   2♣️! Asks for 4 card major. To keep auctions lower, use transfer
        responses:
        -   2♦️! 4♥️s
        -   2♥️! 4♠️s
        -   2♠️! No 4 card major
            -   2NT “sets” notrump and asks for SRAAACA.
        -   Opener can complete the transfer to confirm the fit, which
            initiates SRAAACA, or bid another suit naturally to ask for
            support.
-   2♣️ 8+ 5+♣️s
-   2♦️ 8+ 5+♦️s
-   2♥️! 8+ 4441 singleton heart
    -   After any of the 4441 responses, a bid below game by opener
        creates agreement on the strain and responder will bid according
        to SRAAACA.
-   2♠️! 8+ 4441 singleton spade
-   2NT! 12-13 balanced
    -   3♣️! Asks for 4 card major. Similar to the 1NT response, use
        transfer respones here as well.
        -   3♦️! 4♥️s
        -   3♥️! 4♠️s
        -   3♠️! No 4 card major
        -   Completing the transfer at 3 level shows slam interest.
            Opener should jump to game with minimum hands and a fit.
-   3♣️! 8+ 4441 singleton club
-   3♦️! 8+ 4441 singleton diamond

# After 1:diamonds:\*

-   1♥️ 4+♥️s, one round forcing. With 4/4 spades and hearts and less
    than game forcing values, responder typically starts with 1♥️.
    -   1♠️ 4♠️s, possibly balanced
        -   2-way checkback is on
        -   2♠️ Simple raise (invite would go through 2♣️)
        -   Bids above 2♠️ are game tries with a spade fit, with the
            same meaning as if the bidding started 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️.
    -   1NT Balanced outside of the 1NT opening range, denies 4♠️s
    -   2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    -   2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
        -   2♠️! Artificial game force, “third suit forcing”
    -   2♥️ 4♥️s any strength
-   1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing.
    -   1NT Balanced outside of the 1NT opening range.
    -   2♣️ 5/4+ in the minors, unbalanced. Either minor may be longer.
    -   2♦️ 6+♦️s without significant extra strength.
        -   3♣️! General force, “third suit forcing”. Note that 2♥️ is
            left available to show 5♠️s and 4♥️s nonforcing.
    -   2♥️! Exactly 3=4=5=1, any strength
        -   2NT! Artificial invitational+ asking bid
            -   3♣️! Any minimum
            -   3♦️!, 3♥️!, 3♠️!, 3NT! Maximum with ace or king in suit
                bid (or clubs if NT) and none of the cheaper ones.
    -   2♠️ 4♠️s any strength
-   1NT Nonforcing
-   2♣️! 11+ points, 5+♣️s. Generally denies a 4 card major unless game
    forcing values. Somewhat artificial rebids:
    -   2♦️! Any minimum without 4♥️s
        -   2♥️! Artificial game force, asks for clarification.
            -   Opener continus by bidding shape naturally.
        -   2♠️ Nonforcing, 4♠️s
        -   2NT Nonforcing, natural
        -   3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        -   3♦️ Signoff
        -   3♥️! 6+♣️s, 5+♥️s, slam seeking
        -   3♠️!, 6+♣️s, 5+♠️s, slam seeking
        -   3NT Signoff
    -   2♥️! Minimum with 4♥️s
        -   Pass To play
        -   2♠️! Artificial game force
            -   Opener continues bidding naturally.
        -   2NT Nonforcing, natural
        -   3♣️, Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        -   3♦️ Signoff
        -   3♥️ Invitation to 4♥️, looking for good minimums
    -   2♠️! Maximum, 4♠️s
    -   2NT! Maximum, natural
    -   3♣️! Maximum, 4+♣️s
    -   3♦️! Maximum, 6+♦️s
    -   3♥️! Maximum, 4♥️s
    -   After maximum responses, the auction is forcing to game and
        continuations are natural. If responder confirms a fit below
        game level that implies slam interest (fast arrival).
-   2♦️! 11+ points, 5+♦️s, similar rebids as after 2♣️:
    -   2♥️! Any minimum
        -   2♠️! Artificial game force
            -   Opener continues bidding shape naturally
        -   2NT Nonforcing, natural
        -   3♣️ Nonforcing, 6+♣️s
        -   3♦️ Signoff
    -   Others are maximum and natural, with natural continuations.
    -   Since opener won’t show a 4 card major unless responder game
        forces, it will usually be better to bid 1♥️ or 1♠️ with a 4
        card major and without slam interest. On the other hand, when
        responder does have slam interest, 2♦️ will make it easier to
        find a good diamond fit if it exists.
-   2♥️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long hearts
-   2♠️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long spades
-   2NT Balanced, invitational to game
-   3♣️! Weak jump-shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs
-   3♦️! Preemptive raise
-   If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
-   After a 1♦️-1M-1NT sequence showing 11-13 balanced, [2 way
    checkback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_RD8ycgRT8) is on
    -   2♣️! Weak with diamonds or various invitational hands
        -   2♦️! Forced relay, then responder clarifies
            -   Pass Weak with diamonds
            -   2M Invitational with 5+M
            -   2OM Invitational with 4+OM
    -   2♦️! Artificial game forcing. Natural continuations, favoring
        lowest bids.
        -   2M 3 card support
        -   2OM 4 card unbid major
    -   2M Pulling for partscore, less than invitational values
-   Checkback also applies after 1♦️-1♥️-1♠️, with one addition
    -   1NT Nonforcing and less than invitational. With a hand
        unsuitable for playing 1NT, opener bids 2♣️ with a minor
        two-suiter or 2♦️ with long diamonds.
-   After 1♦️-1♥️-2m, opener has shown an unbalanced hand and denied 4
    spades. Responder’s 2♠️ bid is an artifical game force, and opener
    should continue to describe their hand, especially showing 3 card
    support for a major, prioritizing hearts.
-   After 1♦️-1M-2M, Kokish game tries are available for invitational
    hands, but generally discouraged as they give a significant amount
    of information to the defense. Despite being called game tries, they
    may also be used to investigate slam as opener is forced to bid
    whether they are accepting or not.
    -   Next step (1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♦️-1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified
        help suit game try.
        -   Opener bids the cheapest suit where they have help
            (generally first or second round control). If the auction
            was 1♦️-1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows the spade help and is
            considered the cheapest. Afterward, responder can sign off
            in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another suit asking opener to
            bid game if they have a first or second control in that
            suit.
        -   Opener is also free to bid game directly if they have help
            in every suit or maximal values.
    -   Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
        -   Opener reevaluates their hand in the context of shortness
            and decides whether to bid game or not. Maximal hands may
            choose to play game even with wasted values.

# After 1:hearts:/1:spades:

-   1♥️-1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
    -   After 1♥️-1♠️-1NT, 2 way checkback is on with similar structure
        as after 1♦️-1M-1NT
-   1NT\* Semiforcing. Opener may pass with 11-13 balanced or
    semibalanced, bids 4 card side suit or rebids 6 card major
    otherwise. A side suit bid of 2♠️ should only be made with either
    near-max values or 6/5+ distribution (minimum 5/5 hands would open
    1♠️).
-   2/1 responses are game forcing and natural
    -   2♣️ is either 5+♣️s or any balanced. All other bids are 5+ in
        that suit.
    -   1M-2m-2NT shows a balanced hand with no 4 card side suit. New
        suits from opener ask for help; bid 3NT if responder has a stop
        in that suit, otherwise continue naturally.
-   If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
-   2♥️/2♠️ Invitational with 3+ card support
    -   Opener generally passes or bids 4♥️/4♠️ directly. For borderline
        hands, Kokish game tries are available (description below).
        However, they are discouraged as they will often be more
        valuable tips for the defense than value for us finding the
        right contract.
        -   Next step (1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified help
            suit game try.
            -   Responder bids the cheapest suit where they have help
                (generally first or second round control). If the
                auction was 1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then 2NT! shows the spade
                control and is considered the cheapest. Afterward,
                opener can sign off in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid
                another suit asking responder to bid game if they have a
                first or second control in that suit.
        -   Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
            -   Responder bids 4♥️/4♠️ if they do not have wasted values
                in the suit bid, and 3♥️/3♠️ otherwise.
-   2NT! Game forcing raise with 4+ card support, slam seeking.
    -   3♣️! Minimum without a void
        -   3♦️! Asks (Compare these responses to the immediate response
            to 2NT with a max)
            -   3♥️! Singleton, no long side suit
                -   3♠️! Asks where (use 3NT! for the other major)
            -   3♠️ Unused
            -   3NT! No singleton or long side suit
            -   4♣️! 5+ card club suit
            -   4♦️! 5+ card diamond suit
            -   4♥️! 5+ cards in the other major
    -   3♦️! Minimum with a void
        -   3♥️! Asks where (use 3♠️! for the other major and 3NT! for
            diamonds)
    -   3♥️! Maximum with a singleton, no void or long side suit
        -   3♠️! Asks where (use 3NT! for the other major)
    -   3♠️! Maximum with a void
        -   3NT! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    -   3NT! Maximum with no singleton, void, or long side suit
    -   4♣️! Maximum, 5+ card club suit
    -   4♦️! Maximum, 5+ card diamond suit
    -   4♥️! Maximum, 5+ cards in the other major
-   2♠️!/3♥️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values with the
    suit bid.
-   3♣️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
-   3♦️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long
    diamonds.
-   3♥️!/3♠️! Preemptive raise. Less than invitational with 4+ card
    support.
-   4♥️!/4♠️! To play, no slam interest.

# After 11-13 1NT

-   2♣️ Stayman. The same weak hands are allowed as over the 14-16 1NT.
    With these weak hands you can also consider waiting for opponents to
    double and then utilize the runout system.
-   2♦️! Game forcing relay. Opener describes their exact shape via a
    sequence of bids. Responder can bid a game to sign off at any time.
    The general pattern is for responder to bid the major they don’t
    have, then disambiguate 4 cards or 5 cards, and then bid their
    doubleton, with the nearby bids filling in for doubletons that would
    take too much space to bid directly.
    -   2♥️! 3-♥️s, 4+♠️s or 33(25), includes 4=3=3=3
        -   2♠️! Relay

    -   3♥️! 2=2=4=5
    -   3♠️! 2=2=5=4
    -   After opener has shown their shape, a responder interested in
        slam may bid the cheapest bid (or 4♣️ if the cheapest bid would
        be 3NT) to ask for controls (A=2, K=1):
        -   Step 1: 0-2 controls
        -   Step 2: 3 control
        -   Step 3: 4 controls
        -   etc
    -   After the control step, further relays are denial cue bidding in
        the same manner as in the 1♣️ relay. The possibility of a 0
        control opening is similarly ignored, and if we get into that
        situation we have to pretend the hand has 1 control and hope
        that we can get away with the lie.
    -   If the opponents double 2♦️, relays are on and redouble is an
        attempt to cash in.
    -   Relays are off over any other interference over 2♦️. Doubles are
        penalty as usual for game forcing auctions.
    -   If you’ve chosen to open a (24)(25) hand 1NT, show the major
        doubleton and bid as if it’s (24)(34) accordingly.
-   2♥️ To play
-   2♠️ To play
-   2NT! Weak with both minors
-   3♣️/3♦️/3♥️/3♠️ Invitational natural (usually 6 cards for the
    minors)

## Runouts after 1NT-X or 1NT-P-P-X-P-P

Over a double, runouts are akin to our strong notrump defense. Runouts
are on regardless of whether the double is meant as penalty or not.

-   Pass Suggests playing 1NTx
-   XX Relays to 2♣️ showing either a single minor or both majors
-   2♣️ Clubs and a higher suit (Note: In the defense this is clubs and
    a major, but we would rather not force ourselves to run to 3 level
    with both minors).
-   2♦️ Diamonds and a higher suit
-   2♥️ Natural, to play
-   2♠️ Natural, to play

Any continuation by responder after the natural conclusion of the runout
shows at least invitational values and is forcing. Any suit bid by
opener other than the cheapest one shows a good 5 card suit suggesting
to play there rather than looking for a fit in one of responder’s suits.

# After 14-16 1NT or 1:clubs:!-1:diamonds:!-1NT

-   2♣️ Stayman
    -   Could be several hand types, but always includes a 4 card major:
        -   Garbage stayman (3 suited hand with short clubs)
        -   Crawling stayman (weak hand with both majors)
        -   Weak hand with a 4 card major and a long (probably 6) card
            minor
        -   With a serious invite and 5/4 majors instead start by
            transferring to the 5 card major.
            -   With a 5/4 major hand that only occaisionally wants to
                invite across fitting hands, start with Stayman.
    -   2♦️ No 4+ card major
        -   Pass Garbage stayman or weak with a major and long ♦️s
        -   2♥️ Crawling stayman - weak with both majors. Could be 4-4
            for tactical reasons, but will have longer or equal hearts.
            -   Opener passes except with exactly 3♠️s and 2♥️s
        -   2♠️ Weak with 5♠️s and 4♥️s
        -   2NT Invitational
        -   3♣️!/3♦️! Signoff - weak with a 4 card major and 6 cards in
            the bid minor
        -   3♥️! Smolen - Game forcing with 5♠️s and 4♥️s
        -   3♠️! Smolen - Game forcing with 5♥️s and 4♠️s
    -   2♥️ 4+♥️s, could have 4♠️s
        -   2♠️ Bad invite with 4♠️s.
        -   2NT Invitational without heart fit (implies a 4 card ♠️
            suit), slightly stronger than hands that would bid 2♠️
        -   3♣️/3♦️ Weak with 4♠️s and 6 cards in the bid minor
        -   3♥️ Invitational with a heart fit. Opener can bid 3NT to
            accept if they want to offer a choice of games.
        -   3♠️! Slam try in ♥️s
    -   2♠️ 4+♠️s, denies 4♥️s
        -   2NT Invitational without spade fit (implies a 4 card ♥️
            suit)
        -   3♣️! Signoff - Weak with 4♥️s and long ♣️s
        -   3♦️! Signoff - Weak with 4♥️s and long ♦️s
        -   3♥️! Slam try in ♠️s
        -   3♠️ Invitational with a spade fit. Opener can bid 3NT to
            accept if they want to offer a choice of games.
-   2♦️\* Jacoby transfer to ♥️
    -   2♥️ Generally forced
        -   2♠️! Invitational with 5♥️s and 4♠️s
        -   Other new suits are game forcing and natural.
-   2♥️\* Jacoby transfer to ♠️
    -   2♠️ Generally forced
        -   3♥️! Invitational with 5♠️ and 4♥️s
        -   Other new suits are game forcing and natural.
-   2♠️! Size ask or transfer to clubs
    -   2NT! Minimum
        -   3♣️ Says responder had clubs and wants to sign off
    -   3♣️! Maximum
-   2NT! Transfer to diamonds. Opener responds similar to a size ask
    despite the fact that responder always has the diamonds, to assist
    in judgment if looking for slam.
    -   3♣️! Bad hand/support
        -   3♦️ Sign off
        -   Others are game forcing
    -   3♦️! Good hand and support
        -   Further bids by responder are game forcing
-   3♣️! Game forcing puppet stayman; “low information” version
    -   3♦️! No 5 card major
        -   3♥️! Asks for 4 spades
            -   3♠️ Yes
            -   3NT No
        -   3♠️! Asks for 4 hearts
            -   3NT No
            -   4♥️ Yes
        -   After a 4 card major ask and then 3NT, South African Texas
            transfers are available, which could be done with some
            unusual holdings like 6/4 in majors (check for a 4-4 fit,
            then transfer to the 6 card suit if not).
    -   3♥️ 5♥️s
    -   3♠️ 5♠️s
    -   This version of puppet is “low information” because opener
        doesn’t guarantee a 4 card major with the 3♦️ bid. This is
        possible over 1NT because responder will never want to ask about
        both majors after choosing puppet. If they cared about 4 card
        support in both majors (for example with 4/4 or 5/4 in majors)
        they would have started with 2♣️ for regular stayman.
-   3♦️! Game forcing with 5-5 majors
    -   Opener’s rebids follow fast arrival.
    -   3♥️/3♠️ Fit with a not terrible hand.
    -   3NT Good holdings in both minors, no good fit.
    -   4♥️/4♠️ Fit with a bad hand.
-   3♥️! Game forcing 31(45) (Short ♥️)
    -   3♠️ Fit with a not terrible hand.
    -   3NT Game preference, showing good stoppers in ♥️
    -   4♣️/4♦️ Strong hand with minor fit. Starts a control bidding
        sequence instead of Minorwood because responder is better suited
        to be captain.
    -   4♥️ Strong slam try in ♠️ (5 card suit and appropriately placed
        honors).
    -   4♠️/5♣️/5♦️ Weaker hands with the shown fit.
-   3♠️! Game forcing 13(45) (Short ♠️)
    -   3NT Game preference, showing good stoppers in ♠️
    -   4♣️/4♦️ Strong hand with minor fit. Starts a control bidding
        sequence instead of Minorwood because responder is better suited
        to be captain.
    -   4♥️/5♣️/5♦️ Weaker hands with the shown fit.
    -   4♠️ Strong slam try in ♥️ (5 card suit and appropriately placed
        honors).
-   4♣️\* Texas transfer to ♥️
-   4♦️\* Texas transfer to ♠️
-   4♥️ To play
-   4♠️ To play
-   Systems are on over X and 2♣️
    -   After 1NT-(X), XX is running with either a single minor or both
        majors.
-   Over any interference, Texas transfers are on if the 4♣️ or 4♦️ bid
    is a jump.

# After 2:clubs:!

-   2♦️! Asks for 4 card major, invitational or better, may not have a 4
    card major. Maximum responses establish a game force. ON for passed
    hands (fitting hands can invite with less than 11, as clubs is
    providing us a source of tricks).

    -   To get Minorwood, go through 2♦️ or 3X first.
-   3NT, 4♥️, 4♠️, 5♣️, 5♦️ To play
-   If responder has a 6+ card major, they will generally choose 4 of
    that major as the game to play without checking for support. In the
    case of 6-4 majors, responder should go through 2♦️ to check for the
    possible 4-4 fit.

# After 2:diamonds:!

-   2♥️! Natural, signoff
-   2♠️! Natural, signoff
-   2NT! Forcing asking bid, invitational or better
    -   3♣️! 3=4=1=5
        -   3♦️! Asks opener to bid 3♥️! with a minimum, cheapest cue
            bid of an ace or king with a maximum. Use 3NT for a diamond
            cue, and 4♦️ for a heart cue.
    -   3♦️! 4=3=1=5
        -   3♥️! Asks opener to bid 3♠️! with a minimum, cheapest cue
            bid of an ace or king with a maximum. Use 3NT for a diamond
            cue, and 4♦️ for a spade cue.
    -   3♥️! 4=4=1=4 minimum
    -   3♠️! 4=4=1=4 maximum
    -   3NT! 4=4=1=4 maximum with A/K of ♦️
    -   4♣️! 4=4=0=5 minimum
    -   4♦️! 4=4=0=5 maximum
    -   Note: If you would want to play 3NT across 4=4=0=5 this is not
        the appropriate bid. See 3♦️! below.
-   3♣️! Natural, signoff
-   3♦️! Invitation to 3NT. Requires long diamonds (6+) as opener passes
    with minimum.
-   3♥️ Invite to 4♥️, guarantees 5+♥️s

-   3NT To play
-   4♥️ To play
-   4♠️ To play
-   5♣️ To play
-   5♦️ To play
-   2NT! and 3♦️! are ON in competition.

# After 2:hearts:/2:spades:

Here M refers to the opened major and X refers to any other suit. A
feature is generally an ace or king, and never shortage. The meanings of
maximum and minimum are left unspecified, but adding a king to a maximum
should take it outside of the preempt range, either to pass in hopes of
a better constructive auction or to a one level opening.

-   New suits natural and nonforcing. All strong hands (with interest in
    game) start with 2NT.
-   2NT! Artificial inquiry, invitational or better. Note that because
    of the light preempting style, an invitational hand needs to be
    quite strong. This can also be used for investigating slam and is
    often better suited for that purpose as you can safely sign off in
    4M after any sequence of bids.
    -   3♣️! Any minimum
        -   3♦️! Asks for more clarification
            -   3M! Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature
            -   3X! 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
        -   3M Signoff
        -   4M Signoff
    -   3M! Maximum, Nonvul: 5 card suit, Vulnerable: No outside feature
        and generally has a shortage.
    -   3X! Maximum, 6 card suit and feature in the bid suit.
    -   3NT! Maximum, 6 card suit and no outside feature. If vulnerable,
        also denies shortage.
    -   After any of the above clarifications, responder may still
        introduce a new suit naturally.
-   2NT is ON in competition if available.
-   If the opponents double our weak 2 opening, then new suits are still
    nonforcing, and redouble is SOS showing a desire to run but without
    a clear suit preference.

# After 2NT, 1:clubs:!-1:diamonds:!-2NT, or 1:clubs:!-1:diamonds:!-2:hearts:!-2:spades:!-2NT

-   3♣️! Game forcing puppet stayman
    -   3♦️! No 5 card major, have 4 card major
        -   3♥️! Asks for 4 spades
            -   3♠️ Yes
            -   3NT No
        -   3♠️! Asks for 4 hearts
            -   3NT No
            -   4♥️ Yes
        -   South African Texas available after asking for a 4 card
            major and getting a negative response.
    -   3♥️ 5♥️s
    -   3♠️ 5♠️s
    -   3NT! No 4 or 5 card major
        -   4♣️! Transfer to ♥️ (made with unusual lengths such as 6/4

        -   4♦️! Transfer to ♠️ (made with unusual lengths such as 6/4
            in majors)
        -   4♥️ To play (made with unusal lengths and desire to declare)
        -   4♠️ To play (made with unusal lengths and desire to declare)
    -   Note that this is “high information” puppet stayman, as there
        was no regular stayman available so 3♦️ promising a 4 card major
        ensures that responder can rely on 4 card support for the other
        major after opener denies the first one.

# After 3+ level preempts from our side

# Over Interference

## Direct interference over 1:clubs:!

Because there will be a wide variety of styles of interference, both
natural and artificial, we will avoid ascribing any artificial meaning
to bids that would show the same suits as the opponents, with the
understanding that it is unlikely that we will want to make such a bid.

### Over 1:clubs:-(X)

System is on with a split negative range, redouble shows a semipositive.

### After an overcall

The meanings of our calls (other than double) do not change based on
what the overcall was, so typically only a subset of these options will
be available.

-   Bidding a suit at the 1 level shows a semipositive and a 4 card
    suit. Responder is expected to transfer to 2 level with a 5 card
    suit, so this will typically be exactly a 4 card suit.
-   Doubling at the 1 level shows a semipositive with a suit that wasn’t
    possible to show with a bid.
-   1NT through 2:hearts: are transfers, with similar continuations to
    Jacoby transfers across a 17-19 NT opening.
-   2:spades: is a balanced game force.
-   2NT is also a balanced game force, but with concentration of
    strength in the suit overcalled or shown by the overcall.
-   Doubling an overcall between 1NT and 2NT shows a hand that would
    have been shown by the bid that was doubled For example,
    1:clubs:-(1NT)-X is a transfer to clubs.
-   Bidding a suit at the 3 level is a natural game force.
-   Doubling an overcall at 3 level or higher shows game forcing values
    without clear direction. It is not a penalty double, but as the
    overcall gets higher the expectation is that it gets converted for
    penalty more often.

## After 1M-(?)

-   2M support can be less than invitational
-   Jump raise is preemptive

# Defensive Conventions

## Defense against 1NT

Here “single suit” means 6+ cards, two suiter means 5-4 or better.

### Against strong (ranges that are always 14 or higher)

-   X! Either single suit minor or both majors
    -   2♣️ Forced
        -   Pass 6+♣️s
        -   2♦️ 6+♦️s
        -   2♥️ Both majors, pass or correct to 2♠️
-   2♣️! Clubs and a major
    -   2♦️! Ask for major
-   2♦️! Diamonds and a major
    -   2♥️ Pass or correct to 2♠️
-   2♥️ Natural (5+♥️s)
-   2♠️ Natural (5+♠️s)
-   2NT! Both minors, generally 5/5 or better

### Against weak (13 or lower included in the range)

-   X! Good hand, penalty oriented
-   2♣️ Natural
-   2♦️ Natural
-   2♥️ Natural
-   2♠️ Natural

# Bidding during game forcing auctions

-   Until agreement about denomination, non-jump bids are natural
-   Jump bids are splinters, showing a singleton or void in the suit bid
    and implicitly agreeing the last denomination bid.
-   After agreement, bids are:
    -   Reasonable games are to play or choice of games. A game is
        reasonable if it is 3NT, the suit agreed, or in a suit that was
        previously bid naturally by the other player. Example: After
        1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, the reasonable games are 3NT, 4♥️, and 5♣️.
        -   4NT is generally keycard and not an offer to play
        -   If hearts or spades was bid naturally, then 5♥️/5♠️ is
            generally an offer to play if the auction is already passed
            the corresponding 4 level game.
    -   If a captain is not established, the next bid is SRAAACA (see
        below), and the other player becomes captain.
    -   If a captain is established (Responder after any non-1♣️
        opening, opener if responder made a positive response to 1♣️ as
        a passed hand), then:
        -   A bid by the non-captain is a cue bid, showing a 1st or 2nd
            round control in the suit bid, and denying such controls
            that could have been shown with cheaper bids. A notrump bid
            denies all controls that could have been shown with a
            cheaper bid.
            -   Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-2♦️-2♥️, responder is captain but
                opener is to bid, so they start with a cue bid after
                which responder can make asking bids.
        -   A bid by the captain is asking about the non-captain’s
            holding in the suit bid, with the following steps:
            -   Step 1: No help (xx or worse)
            -   Step 2: Unreliable second round control e.g. Kx
            -   Step 3: Reliable second round control e.g. KQx
            -   Step 4: Singleton (not ace)
            -   Step 5: Ace
            -   Step 6: Void
            -   Example: After 1♥️-2♣️-3♣️, 3♦️! asks about diamonds
                with 3♥️! being step 1, 3♠️ being step 2, 3NT being step
                3, and so on.
        -   If the asking bid suit was previously bid naturally by the
            player being asked, the scale is different (note: the bid
            must be below game, otherwise it is a reasonable game and
            therefore an offer to play).
            -   Step 1: No top honors (A/K/Q)
            -   Step 2: One top honor
            -   Step 3: Two top honors
            -   Step 4: Three top honors
            -   Step 5: Three top honors and 6+ cards
-   Doubles are penalty

## SRAAACA (pronounced like Sriracha)

The name stands for “Strength Response After Agreement in Ambiguous
Captain Auctions”. If both sides are unlimited during a game forcing
auction (only positive responses by a non-passed hand after 1♣️ opening)
and agreement occurs below game level, the next bid defines the strength
of the hand and the hand that created the agreement becomes the captain.

Responses are overlapping 3-point intervals spaced 2 apart. Judgment
should be used to decide whether to show borderline hands in the higher
or lower range.

Example: After 1♣️-1♥️-2♥️, responder is 8+ so the steps are

-   2♠️! 8-10
-   2NT! 10-12
-   3♣️! 12-14
-   3♦️! 14-16
-   And so on

Example 2: After 1♣️-1♥️-1♠️-2♠️, opener is 16+ so the steps are

-   2NT! 16-18
-   3♣️! 18-20
-   3♦️! 20-22
-   3♥️! 22-24
-   And so on

Exception: If agreement was made by a splinter, it is better for the
hand opposite the shown shortness to be captain for better bidding
accuracy. Relaying asks for strength, other bids outside the trump suit
are directly asking about help in that suit, and notrump asks for a cue
bid (4NT remains keycard). An ask in the splinter suit is for clarity on
the shortness, whether immediately or after a relay for strength.

When shortness is shown, 3NT is no longer considered an offer to play.

Example 3: After 1♣️!-1♥️-3♦️!

-   3♥️! Asks for strength
    -   3♠️! 16-18
    -   3NT! 18-20
    -   And so on
-   3♠️! Asks about spade holding
-   3NT! Demands cue bid
-   4♣️! Asks about club holding
-   4♦️! Asks about shortness
    -   4♥️! Singleton
    -   4♠️! Void

If the splintering player is already limited, then the strength relay is
just a regular asking bid.

Example 4: After P-1♣️!-1♥️-1♠️-3♣️!, note that the initial pass limits
responder to 8-10.

-   3♦️! Asks about diamond holding
-   3♥️! Asks about heart holding
-   3NT! Demands cue bid
-   4♣️! Asks about shortness
    -   4♦️! Singleton
    -   4♥️! Void
-   4♠️ Signoff

# Miscellaneous

-   Tactical Deviations
    -   Judgment may be used to use a bid that is technically a lie if
        it describes the hand better or is likely to lead to better
        outcomes practically. For example, it is allowed to hide a very
        weak 4 card suit, treating it as 3 cards.
-   RKC 1430
    -   Jump to 4NT after a suit-showing bid without an agreed
        denomination implicitly agrees the suit just shown.
    -   After response:
        -   Next step other than the trump suit is queen ask
            -   Cheapest trump bid = no queen
            -   Others = queen + king in shown suit
            -   Notrump = queen + no outside king
        -   5NT is king ask, guarantees all relevant key cards
            -   Responder bids cheapest king. A higher suit below the
                agreed trump can then be bid to ask responder to bid 7
                with that king.
        -   Directly bidding 6 of a suit lower than trump asks responder
            to bid 7 with the queen of that suit and 6 otherwise. If
            space permits, responder may bid 6 of a higher suit still
            below the trump suit to deny the asked queen but show
            another queen.
    -   DOPI over interference (Double = 0 or 3, Pass = 1 or 4, Step = 2
        or 5 w/o queen, 2 steps = 2 or 5 w/ queen, assuming space
        permits)
-   Exclusion Keycard
    -   Jump to 5 of a suit shows a void in that suit and asks for
        keycards outside.
    -   Responses are in steps:
        -   First step 0 outside keycards
        -   Second step 1 outside keycard without the trump queen
        -   Third step 1 outside keycard with the trump queen
        -   Fourth step 2 outside keycards without the trump queen
        -   Fifth step 2 outside keycards with the trump queen
    -   3 keycards doesn’t need a response because initiator will need
        to have one or else the 2 keycard response takes the auction too
        high.
-   Minorwood
    -   4 of a minor is the keycard ask if the following conditions are
        met:
        -   We are in a game forcing auction
        -   We have not established a major fit
        -   We have established a fit in the minor (even if it was
            implied or if 4m is the first time it is shown).
    -   Responses are the usual 1430 responses in steps.
        -   First step 1 or 4
        -   Second step 0 or 3
        -   Third step 2 without queen
        -   Fourth step 2 with queen
    -   If available, the step up from the response is the queen ask,
        but 4NT is always to play and not the queen ask.
    -   If clubs are trump, 5♦️ is the king ask, and if diamonds are
        trump, 5♥️ is the king ask. The 5NT response stands in to show
        the king of the suit used to ask.
    -   If both Minorwood and SRAAACA would apply, Minorwood takes
        precedence.

## Lebensohl

### After a direct 2-level overcall of our 1NT opening

If the opponents overcall 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️ directly over our 1NT opening
(systems are on over 2♣️), regardless of which range, 2NT by responder
is a relay to 3♣️ to show a hand that is interested in competing to 3
level, but not interested in investigating game (except in the case
where responder continues by cue bidding the opponent’s suit). After the
3♣️ relay, responder either passes or bids their suit naturally.

For suits above the overcalled suit, introducing the suit at two level
is nonforcing. Lebensohl can be used to show an invitational hand.
Jumping to three level shows a game force.

Cue bidding the opponent’s suit is instead stayman, either showing a
stopper in the overcalled suit or not depending on whether the 2NT relay
is used. The direct cue bid denies a stopper (“fast denies”), while the
relay and then cue bidding shows a stopper (“slow shows”).

Over a balancing overcall, responder has already passed, presumably
denying game interest, so Lebensohl does not apply.

Example situation: 1NT-(2♥️)-? \* 2♠️ Natural and nonforcing \* 2NT!
Lebensohl \* 3♣️! Forced \* Pass Hand that wants to compete to 3♣️ but
without game interest \* 3♦️ Hand that wants to compete to 3♦️ but
without game interest \* 3♥️! “Stayman with a stopper”, game forcing \*
3♠️ Natural and invitational \* 3♣️ Natural and invitational \* 3♦️
Natural and invitational \* 3♥️! “Stayman without a stopper”, game
forcing \* 3♠️ Natural and game forcing \* 3NT To play

### After a takeout double of an opposing weak 2

If the opponents open a weak 2♦️, 2♥️, or 2♠️, and our side doubles for
takeout, 2NT is a relay to 3♣️ to show a weak hand (generally 0-7).
Unlike in the previous situation, sometimes the doubler will break the
relay to show a very strong hand that has interest in going further
despite the 0-7 points.

Example situation: (2♥️)-X-? \* 2♠️ Natural and weak \* 2NT! Lebensohl,
generally shows a weak hand \* 3♣️! Nearly forced, shows that it was not
a power double \* Pass Wants to play \* 3♦️ Natural and weak \* 3♥️!
“Stayman with a stopper”, game forcing \* 3♠️ Natural and invitational
\* 3♣️ Natural and invitational \* 3♦️ Natural and invitational \* 3♥️!
“Stayman without a stopper”, game forcing \* 3♠️ Natural and game
forcing \* 3NT To play

## Unusual vs Unusual

If the opponents make a bid showing two known suits (such as Michael’s
or Unusual 2NT), then a cue bid of the lower suit is a stronger bid of
the lower unshown suit, and a cue bid of the higher suit is a stronger
bid of the higher unshown suit. Strength for the cue bids is usually
inv+, or 8-10 if by a passed hand. As a consequence, bidding one of the
other two suits naturally is merely competitive.

Examples: \* After 1♦️-(2♦️), if 2♦️ shows both majors then 2♥️ is a
strong club bid and 2♠️ is a strong diamond bid. \* After 1♥️-(2NT)
showing both minors, 3♣️ is a strong heart raise, and 3♦️ is a strong
spade bid.

## Cue bid of an opposing weak 2

After the opponents open with a weak 2, the direct cue bid is a stopper
ask, showing a hand that is looking for 3NT, but lacks a stopper and is
unsuitable for a takeout double. The exact nature of the hand is
unspecified; it could be a strong balanced hand without a stopper or a
hand with a likely running suit.

## 3-suit Keycard

If opener has shown a 3-suited hand (for example, after a 2♦️ opening),
then 4♣️, 4♦️, and 4NT are the keycard asks in the low, middle, and high
suits respectively, as long as none are needed as signoff bids. If some
are signoff, then the remaining bids are keycard for as many suits as
possible, prioritizing long suits, and higher suits between those of
equal length. In all cases, the cheaper bid corresponds to keycard in
the lower suit.

When 3-suit keycard applies, the suit above the trump suit is the king
asking bid, with one very important exception. If not every suit was
available to keycard in, then a bid in the unavailable suit should be
considered signoff instead of king ask. The first available bid
(possibly 5NT) is the king ask instead. This allows the captain to
keycard in another suit if they deem that information to be good enough
for finding slam in the unavailable suit. When responding to the king
ask, 5NT fills in as indicating the king of the suit used to initiate
the ask.

Example 1: After a 2♦️ opening, a direct response of 4♣️ is keycard in
clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 2: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️ showing 3=4=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is
not needed as signoff (responder could pass), so 4♣️ is keycard in
clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 3: After 2♦️-2NT-3♦️ showing 4=3=1=5 and any strength, 4♣️ is a
signoff bid, so only 4♦️ and 4NT are keycard bids. In this case, hearts
is the shortest suit and therefore not given a keycard bid, so 4♦️ is
keycard in clubs and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 4: After 2♦️-2NT-3♠️ showing 4=4=1=4 and a maximum without the
diamond A or K, 4♣️ and 4♦️ are not needed as signoff as opener has
shown a maximum after an invitational bid. Therefore, 4♣️ is keycard in
clubs, 4♦️ is keycard in hearts, and 4NT is keycard in spades.

Example 5: After 2♦️-2NT-3♣️-3♦️-3♥️ Showing 3=4=1=5 and a minimum, 4♣️
is a signoff so 4♦️ is keycard in clubs and 4NT is keycard in hearts.
After a response to 4NT, 5♠️ is a signoff indicating that responder had
long spades, since it was impossible to keycard in spades, and 5NT is
instead the king ask.

## Doubles of an opponent’s 1 minor opening

### Direct doubles of 1:clubs: that contains weak (less than 15) options

This category includes standard 1♣️, Polish Club, “may be short” 1♣️
with transfer responses, Tangerine Club, and so on. It also includes
strong 1♣️ where the range starts at 14 or lower, such as some versions
of MOSCITO.

Double is a major-oriented takeout double. Power doubles are still
included. Most of the balanced hands that would open 1♦️ fall into this
category, but you should always have at least 4-3 in the majors. The
exact point range is still to be determined, but should not be much
lighter than an opening. Responses are similar to responding to a 1♦️
opening, but with an artificial negative response. Alternatively, you
can think about this as similar to responding to a Polish Club.

-   After (1♣️) X (P)
    -   1♦️ Usually 0-8 points, does not have a 4 card major if 7-8.
        Could be up to 10 with a long minor that does not want to bid
        NT.
        -   1♥️ 4♥️s, may also have 4♠️s less than power double,
            nonforcing
        -   1♠️ 4♠️s without 4♥️s, less than power double, nonforcing
            -   After these 1♥️ or 1♠️ bids, all bids are nonforcing,
                but both sides should be inclined to bid if at the top
                of their range.
        -   1NT 18-19 balanced
            -   1NT systems are on
        -   2♣️, 2♦️, 2♥️, 2♠️ Natural, power double strength
    -   1♥️ 7+ points, 4+♥️s, forcing
        -   Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♥️, including 2 way
            checkback when applicable.
    -   1♠️ 7+ points, 4+♠️s, forcing, usually longer ♠️ than ♥️
        -   Continuations are the same as 1♦️-1♠️, including 2 way
            checkback when applicable.
    -   1NT 9-11 balanced
    -   2♣️ 11+ points, 5+♣️, forcing
        -   Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♣️
    -   2♦️ 11+ points, 5+♦️, forcing
        -   Same rebid structure as after 1♦️-2♦️
    -   2♥️ Weak, 6+♥️s
        -   Opener should still continue bidding with power double
            strength.
    -   2♠️ Weak, 6+♠️s
        -   Opener should still continue bidding with power double
            strength.
    -   2NT 12-13 balanced

### Doubles of a purely strong (always 15+) 1:clubs: or 1:diamonds:

This category includes Precision’s 1♣️, Magic Diamond’s 1♦️, and so on.

Double shows 4-4 or better in the majors. Compared to doubling a
standard 1♣️, the hand may be weaker. Because the opponents have made a
strong opening, there is no emphasis on finding a game, and more
emphasis on preempting when possible. This meaning also applies to
doubling the artificial negative response (e.g. against Precision, (1♣️)
P (1♦️) X would be majors).

### Direct doubles of a natural 1:diamonds:

This category includes standard 1♦️, especially those that are paired
with a “may be short” 1♣️ to guarantee 5. The original Precision 1♦️
also promised 4+, and would fall into this category.

Double is takeout. However, there is still some major bias because it
pays to be aggressive with overcalling 2♣️ with 5, as it makes it
significantly more difficult for the opponents to find their 4-4 major
fit.

### Doubles of a “may be short” 1:diamonds:

This category includes modern Precision 1♦️ (whether 0+, 1+, or 2+).

Double is takeout of either minor (either minor can be the short suit),
which typically means that it will have at least 4-3 in majors.
Responses are like responding to a takeout double, but biased toward the
majors.

### Balancing doubles

After the auction (1♣️) P (P), even if opener doesn’t have clubs,
responder generally will.

Double is takeout.

## Interference over artificial asks

This includes:

-   1NT (11-13)-2♦️
-   2♣️-2♦️ (both versions)
-   2♦️-2♥️ (open chart)
-   2♦️-2NT (basic chart)

If they double, then redouble is an offer to play, and otherwise we
ignore the double.

If they overcall with the lowest step, then pass take the place of the
first step (the bid that the opponents made), double shows a hand with
reasonable penalty prospects, and other bids retain their meaning.

If they overcall with the second step and we are in a game force, e.g.
1NT-2♦️-(2♠️), pass shows the first step with double being the next ask,
and double shows the second step (which is the bid the opponents took),
with subsequent bids having the same meaning.

If they overcall with the second step and we are in an invitational
sequence, then pass includes most mininums, and other calls are natural.

If they overcall higher, then all calls are natural.
