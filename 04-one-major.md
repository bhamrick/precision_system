# After 1:hearts:/1:spades:

* 1♥️-1♠️ 4+♠️s, one round forcing
    * After 1♥️-1♠️-1NT, 2 way checkback is on with similar structure as after
      1♦️-1M-1NT
* 1NT\* Semiforcing. Opener may pass with 11-13 balanced or semibalanced, bids 4
  card side suit or rebids 6 card major otherwise. A side suit bid of 2♠️ should
  only be made with either near-max values or 6/5+ distribution (minimum 5/5
  hands would open 1♠️).
* 2/1 responses are game forcing and natural
  * 2♣️ is either 5+♣️s or any balanced. All other bids are 5+ in that suit.
  * 1M-2m-2NT shows a balanced hand with no 4 card side suit. New suits from
    opener ask for help; bid 3NT if responder has a stop in that suit, otherwise
    continue naturally.
* If responder is a passed hand, all responses are nonforcing.
* 2♥️/2♠️ Invitational with 3+ card support
    * Opener generally passes or bids 4♥️/4♠️ directly. For borderline hands,
      Kokish game tries are available (description below). However, they are
      discouraged as they will often be more valuable tips for the defense than
      value for us finding the right contract.
        * Next step (1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! or 1♠️-2♠️-2NT!): Unspecified help suit game try.
            * Responder bids the cheapest suit where they have help (generally
              first or second round control). If the auction was 1♥️-2♥️-2♠️! then
              2NT! shows the spade control and is considered the cheapest.
              Afterward, opener can sign off in 3♥️/3♠️ or 4♥️/4♠️, or bid another
              suit asking responder to bid game if they have a first or second
              control in that suit.
        * Other suits: Short suit game try (2NT! asks for spades)
            * Responder bids 4♥️/4♠️ if they do not have wasted values in the suit
              bid, and 3♥️/3♠️ otherwise.
* 2NT! Game forcing raise with 4+ card support, slam seeking.
    * 3♣️! Minimum without a void
        * 3♦️! Asks (Compare these responses to the immediate response to 2NT with
          a max)
            * 3♥️! Singleton, no long side suit
                * 3♠️! Asks where (use 3NT! for the other major)
            * 3♠️ Unused
            * 3NT! No singleton or long side suit
            * 4♣️! 5+ card club suit
            * 4♦️! 5+ card diamond suit
            * 4♥️! 5+ cards in the other major
    * 3♦️! Minimum with a void
        * 3♥️! Asks where (use 3♠️! for the other major and 3NT! for diamonds)
    * 3♥️! Maximum with a singleton, no void or long side suit
        * 3♠️! Asks where (use 3NT! for the other major)
    * 3♠️! Maximum with a void
        * 3NT! Asks where (use 4♥️! for spades when hearts are trump)
    * 3NT! Maximum with no singleton, void, or long side suit
    * 4♣️! Maximum, 5+ card club suit
    * 4♦️! Maximum, 5+ card diamond suit
    * 4♥️! Maximum, 5+ cards in the other major
* 2♠️!/3♥️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values with the suit bid.
* 3♣️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long clubs.
* 3♦️! Weak jump shift: Less than constructive values and long diamonds.
* 3♥️!/3♠️! Preemptive raise. Less than invitational with 4+ card support.
* 4♥️!/4♠️! To play, no slam interest.
