# Guiding Principles

* Open light. Bidding is more fun than not bidding, and also comes with
  some preemptive benefits. Even playing standard, 11 point hands sometimes get
  upgraded to pretend to be a 13 count. We just systematically open them.
  * However, light is not trash. E.g. 10 point balanced hand is not worth an upgrade.
* Establish a captain of the auction quickly. For openings other than 1♣️,
  responder is immediately the captain as opener's range is limited.
  * If the auction goes P-1♣️-positive response, then responder is known to be
    8-10 and therefore opener is captain.
  * For 1♣️-positive response from nonpassed hands, we have an agreement called
    SRAAACA to define the range of one of the hands.
* Play partscores two levels below game when possible. For example, 3♥️ is really
  only a good place to be when you're making exactly 9 tricks. The effect of
  this can be seen in the invite sequences. For example, 2♣️-2♦️-2♥️ implies a
  minimum so that we don't need to continue to the 3 level when responder is
  invitational (opener would be 3♥️ instead with a maximum).
  * This does not apply for preemptive bids
* Game force early to have plenty of bidding space for finding the right game or
  slam.
  * Note: That bidding space is not particularly well used yet.
* Be Basic Chart legal. Both partners are significantly below 750 masterpoints
  and we don't want to practice a Basic+ system just to need to switch when
  playing at events with low limits.

# Notation

Throughout the document, a ! next to a bid means it's alertable. A \* indicates
that it would carry an announcement. Alerts at 4 level and higher starting with
opener's rebid are delayed alerts instead.
