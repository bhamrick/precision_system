# Over Interference

## Direct interference over 1:clubs:!

Because there will be a wide variety of styles of interference, both natural and
artificial, we will avoid ascribing any artificial meaning to bids that would
show the same suits as the opponents, with the understanding that it is unlikely
that we will want to make such a bid.

### Over 1:clubs:-(X)

System is on with a split negative range. Redouble shows a semipositive,
roughly 5-7 but judgment is expected.

### After an overcall

The meanings of our calls (other than double) do not change based on what the
overcall was, so typically only a subset of these options will be available.

* Bidding a suit at the 1 level shows a semipositive and a 4 card suit.
  Responder is expected to transfer to 2 level with a 5 card suit, so this will 
  typically be exactly a 4 card suit.
* Doubling at the 1 level shows a semipositive with a suit that wasn't
  possible to show with a bid.
* 1NT through 2:hearts: are transfers, with similar continuations to Jacoby
  transfers across a 17-19 NT opening.
* 2:spades: is a balanced game force.
* 2NT is also a balanced game force, but with concentration of strength in the
  suit overcalled or shown by the overcall.
* Doubling an overcall between 1NT and 2NT shows a hand that would have been
  shown by the bid that was doubled For example, 1:clubs:-(1NT)-X is a transfer
  to clubs.
* Bidding a suit at the 3 level is a natural game force.
* Doubling an overcall at 3 level or higher shows game forcing values without
  clear direction. It is not a penalty double, but as the overcall gets higher
  the expectation is that it gets converted for penalty more often.

## After 1M-(?)

* 2M support can be less than invitational
* Jump raise is preemptive
