# Over Interference

## Direct interference over 1♣️!

Because there will be a wide variety of styles of interference, both natural and
artificial, we will avoid ascribing any artificial meaning to bids that would
show the same suits as the opponents, with the understanding that it is unlikely
that we will want to make such a bid.

### Over 1X (or Double)

* Pass! 0-4
* X!/XX! 5-7 "semipositive"
* All others natural and game forcing

### Over 2X

* All non-jump bids transfer to next higher suit, including double
* Opener will generally accept the transfer with the following exceptions
    * Jumping in the transfered-to suit shows a very strong hand (wanting to
      play game across a random semipositive hand).
    * Bidding another suit shows 0-1 cards in the transfer suit and a good
      alternative suit (5 cards at worst, ideally a good 6).
    * Bidding a suit instead of accepting a transfer to no trump shows a
      distributional hand with the suit bid.
    * Jumping in another suit shows both a very strong hand and lack of support.
* Responder continuing after any of these rebids is game forcing.

Because the 1♣️ opener could have any distribution, transfers with a weak hand
should generally have at least a 6 card suit. However, if responder transfers
and then continues with a game forcing auction, it may be only 5 cards, and
opener should be sure to show real support after accepting the transfer if they
have 3.

Example: After 1♣️!-(2♥️)

* X! Transfer to spades
* 2♠️! Transfer to no trump
* 2NT! Transfer to clubs
* 3♣️! Transfer to diamonds
* 3♦️! Transfer to hearts

### Over 3X and higher

* All bids are natural and game forcing
* Double is game forcing values without clear direction, more penalty oriented
  at higher levels

## After 1M-(?)

* 2M support can be less than invitational
* Jump raise is preemptive
